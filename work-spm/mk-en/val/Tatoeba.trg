I'm not going to let Tom go home early.
The men seized their sharpened sabres without hesitation.
Tom is always polite.
What should I do with that?
The thermostat is defective.
You didn't see this one coming, did you, Tom?
Tom asked Mary to quiet down.
Someone's shooting.
There is a swan in the water there.
He is raising tropical fishes.
I can still remember the first time I saw you.
I'll graduate this year.
I need nine hours of sleep.
You've certainly outdone Tom.
The next question is for him.
I have to eat, too.
I'm not pessimistic.
Do you know much about him?
I'll get out of your way.
Why did you bring them here?
That made Tom pause.
Tom is a bad cook.
Would you like to go with me?
That was too easy.
Let's go by train.
What an awful tragedy!
This is my grandmother.
It's all over now.
You guys are stupid.
Tom is the greatest.
What's really bothering them?
Let's just think about it.
Here's the letter from her.
Tom knew Mary.
"Oh. You're alive?" "Yes. Where is everyone?" "Dunno."
I'd be happy to help.
He is studying the origin of jazz in America.
He is allergic to dust.
Tom's tough.
Yesterday, my wheelbarrow was stolen.
Tom didn't take it.
Could I place this here?
Mary takes after her mother.
The dip burned my tongue.
Where's Tom's file?
I have a different opinion on that subject.
Hey look, it's Tom.
Didn't anybody tell you that you didn't have to be here today?
Tom used a level to check whether the wall was straight.
Tom wouldn't have made it on time if he hadn't run.
There are all kind of things in her wallet.
Get her some water.
I should take a look.
You'd better go help Tom.
That's Tom's office.
I'm trying to work.
I've already seen it.
You are quite a man.
Excuse me, I'm looking for her.
After all the merrymaking, the apartment was in great disarray.
Tom seemed depressed.
Please bear this fact in mind.
I need to understand.
I usually jerk off to porn rather than my own fantasies.
Tom didn't think so.
Tom didn't object.
Is that your room?
I want Tom to leave.
That's foolish.
I think you've been spending too much time in Boston.
You'd better be very sure before you accuse them of anything.
You're the sweetest.
Are you going to throw that away?
Tom's work is sloppy.
Don't blow things out of proportion.
Hungry?
The king did not see the end of the monarchy coming.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
The sky clouded over.
Tom doesn't know how the computer works.
Read Tom a story and put him to bed.
Tom said that he'd be late.
I'm all by myself.
How did you get that idea?
That was his personal opinion.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
He walks on crutches.
I disagree with you.
Dan appears to have had several surgeries in the leg.
Can you speak louder, please?
Come home.
Since when?
Either way, you lose.
He deserves punishment.
My hobby is languages.
Maybe I'll try it.
It's going to be hard to live without Tom.
Is it going to rain?
I spent the day with Tom.
Don't mention the war!
I'll call Tom back.
I'll be busy all next week.
Has he not been feeling well for months now?
That's what people call me.
What is in the backpack?
Were you really surprised?
We'll never use those.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
The boys are shy.
Don't forget him.
Tom gave Mary the information she needed.
I punched his jaw.
Let's meet at 6:30.
I won't be going with you to Boston.
I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore.
Did you help them?
She's very childish.
I'm on my way now.
They're both dead.
Tom almost always helps Mary with her homework.
I just got her off to school.
He is a dentist.
Look, look at that shark, which has followed us all night - why it is only waiting for you to get into the water to swallow you.
Walk slowly.
Friend me on Facebook. Huh, what's that? Really, so you don't do Facebook? You must not have any friends. That's terrible.
Long live the Emperor!
Tom isn't artistic.
Tom is clearly lost.
Don't you understand?
I got one for us.
Tom sighed deeply.
That store gives good service.
He's Tom's chauffeur.
I was in a bad mood.
I've never told anybody this before.
They kept drinking.
Tom didn't answer any more questions.
Mary is said to have been a great singer when she was young.
I didn't want to appear hypocritical.
Tom is probably dead.
Let's hustle, Tom.
Does Tom look upset?
For personal reasons.
Tom can handle that.
It's dark.
I already gave her your number.
She began to sing.
I just want it to be special.
I've heard of it.
That helped a lot.
My watch says 2:30.
Didn't you see that?
Tom doesn't often do his homework before dinner.
Tom really wants to go home right now.
I guess both of us are a little sleepy.
Of course, I'll marry you.
Tom seemed to have thought so.
Tom loves having Mary around.
Sitting down all day is bad for you.
You said you'd help.
The traitor poisoned the master.
Where did you look?
You'll embarrass them.
They're all lying.
Don't push.
I'd like you to meet João.
Dan pulled Linda out of the car.
Have you ever been shot at before?
I totally agree with that.
Tom baited the hook.
There is a black BMW parked in front of your house.
The soup is too salty.
Tom told me why he'd decided to study French.
The human body has a mysterious power to keep itself healthy and sound.
I know a place where we can get a drink.
Tom teaches English at a local school.
Give them the facts.
Put away your toys.
That's good.
My father cut wood with a saw.
I wonder where Tom is right now.
Tom was insincere.
In addition, I can fly.
Haven't I told you everything already?
We laughed at Tom.
Are you worried about him?
Tom sent one to me.
Oh shit! I've lost my keys!
I knew it was a lie.
I grabbed the cat by the neck.
I just wanted to come home.
He was born in the winter.
Give him a chair.
I love the flowers you sent me.
Why did it have to be him?
Can I touch this one too?
I know that you know.
I wouldn't hurt Tom.
Put your gloves on.
Sentence mixing is funny.
I'm not ready to give up.
They also built a sand castle.
I know I'm being selfish.
He nodded to show that he approved of my plan.
Who found this?
Why blame him?
I talk in my sleep.
Always praise he who brought coffee to Europe.
Tom is really busy, isn't he?
We're both idiots.
I told Tom I'd think about it.
Tom didn't live up to our expectations.
Smoke appeared.
The sailors abandoned the burning ship.
Tom was never that bad.
Tom loved animals.
Bring help.
Tom left some food on his plate.
How did this happen?
The grass looks nice.
Well, I lied.
Don't come near me.
This whiskey is too strong.
I'm your boyfriend.
There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Tom.
It's a great honor to finally meet you.
You're a moron.
Tom is really peeved.
Tom drinks.
There is no path to peace. Peace is the path.
Would you stop that?
You're unfriendly.
Their boat needs painting.
Do you think I'm to blame?
Don't think about it.
I'd love to meet Tom.
You're lost.
The giant awoke!
They moved to the village, where they lived a happy life.
Why can't they do it?
Why would I be offended?
I just hope I didn't bore you.
I hadn't realized what was going on.
What an oddball he is!
Tom yelled at Mary.
We are cousins.
They want justice.
It's the other one.
Take your headphones off.
It seems that his secretary knows a truth.
Don't call them.
I'd like to go inside.
I wish we could do that.
I can see a strange blue bird on the roof.
The police can't arrest him.
Traitors will be deported.
The word is unfamiliar to me.
We see with our eyes.
Tom doesn't actually play much.
When was the last time you rode a bicycle?
I'm going to lunch.
Tom hated that photo.
Tom's French is quite good already.
Tom keeps looking at you.
Follow me.
I've been eating protein.
Where do I go now?
Tom put on a coat.
Tom loves to sing.
Who's here?
We should get together sometime.
Tom didn't even give Mary a chance to explain.
I asked them to do it for me.
I don't like cheese.
Tom might arrive a couple of hours before Mary does.
Tom deceived Mary.
Do you know how to tie your shoes?
Isn't that awesome?
Give me half a kilo of tomatoes.
Who was it?
Do you ever think about her?
Tom winked at Mary.
I'm not going to get up.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to me.
You have to go the rest of the way without me.
Egg yolk is one of the major sources of vitamin A.
Things happened fast.
I ate a light lunch.
Hanako and Taro went to eat some sushi.
Let's be candid for a moment.
Tom spit out his gum.
I don't know the bride.
When you criticize his work, you should take into account his lack of experience.
Let's get them.
It's a pleasure to have you with us again.
We're going to crash.
They didn't do it.
Tom is in a hurry.
I'm Tom's nanny.
I'm your partner.
Tom put on his cufflinks.
My fingers are numb.
I heard them come in.
When will he come?
Tom wants to work in a hospital.
Mary is socially awkward.
I didn't have anything to do with Tom's death.
Don't worry about us.
They've arrested him.
I hate myself because I'm ugly.
Who's paying for the gas?
Tom is very famous.
Put some music on.
Tom is the most valuable player on our team.
These boots are expensive.
Why did I do that?
The cat dug its claws into my hand.
We're not married.
We were happier than we had ever believed possible.
We were just in Boston.
My bladder is bursting.
I sure hope you'll come again.
In university towns, people are constantly coming and going.
They were traitors.
I can hear perfectly well.
Tom wants to speak to you.
We're at war with Japan.
Can anyone top this?
I need help carrying her.
Where did you meet your wife?
Tom is sick in bed.
This sounds healthy.
We're coming for you.
I always wanted a dog.
Who wants to fight?
I guess I'll stay a while.
Tom has got more restraint than I do.
Aren't you hot? Why don't you take off your sweater?
What did you get her?
She's wearing high heels.
Please pull the rope.
Tom isn't creative.
I miss Tom already.
It's a proven fact.
I go to bed at 10.30.
I want kids.
I am a man.
Can you give me something for the pain?
They were all strong men.
I won't bother you.

They're in the car.
Being a policeman isn't any fun.
What use are you to me?
No one respects me.
I'm sincere.
Let's do one thing at a time.
Tom put some coins in the box.
Have you ever swallowed an apricot pit?
Go ahead and do it.
If you want to feed your pet, you must treat it well.
Someone attacked us.
Tom died of old age.
I was just talking about him.
The question is who will do it.
I didn't vote for him.
You really annoy me.
I'll be back for you later.
His words and deeds do not match.
Get changed.
I can't leave Boston.
I think this is the best place to eat in town.
I can wait.
What is that smell?
You cook turkey with pears.
It's about time you were independent of your parents.
Tom fed the sheep.
It was useless.
I'm not sitting here.
He always parades his knowledge of English.
You're being conned.
She's a real expert.
How did you convince her?
Translating this text will be very simple.
That's not very good.
Tom is good for nothing.
I urgently need you.
Tom escaped from the dungeon.
Dan stated that he was a cop.
Could you excuse us?

Bring me a drink.
Are you talking about them?

It's evil to curse.
The problem was time.
You're wrong, Tom.
How will Tom get in?
Vote for her.
It has my name on it.
I can't remember where I first met him.
And now, where is my pen?
Tom has been great.
Tom aspires to be a teacher.
Tom doesn't really want to go with us.
Where is his family?
I think I'd rather be fishing.
I just saw the news.
Tom ate steak for dinner.
Don't catch a cold.
Maybe we should go to Boston.

I'm clean.
What don't you like about him?

I think this is a dream.
Tom was distraught.

If I were rich, I'd pass my time in travelling.
I'm not a traitor.
Tom leased an office.
Tom and Mary sat down to talk.
I do the best I can.
Tom could still be in Boston.
My ear is itching.
What did you decide?
When does it begin?
We could talk about Tom.
I wish I had the will power to stop eating junk food.
This is a no smoking zone.
Tom seems to be sick.
Tom is trying very hard.
Don't teach me how to live!
How can you help them?
Do you know that boy who's crying?
I got stung by a bee.
That island is American territory.
I had a pretty good day.
Has Tom told Mary yet?
This is a public street, not a racetrack.
Which one was Tom?
It wasn't a fair fight.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind.
I still want to talk to you.
Is now a good time to talk?
Can you smell that?
We're not being sued.
It was from him.
You are a good cook.
There's plenty of water.
You handled that badly, Tom.
They both sat down.

I won't discuss this with you or anyone else.
Does he like his job ?
The man died of thirst in a dry country.
I took the cake out of the oven too early.
That's so strange.
Tom is allergic to mould.
I dislike eggs.
Do you have any non-alcoholic drinks?
We need your help finding her.
Keep a low profile.
I am talking with Tom.
My foot hurts.
I think they like us.
We'll follow them.
I have no will power when it comes to dieting.
I need some answers from you.
You can't watch the game.
Why don't you help them?
Tom never told me why he wasn't here the day before yesterday.
I'm on my way home.
We haven't yet decided where we'll go tomorrow.

You revealed your feelings.
The radioactive cloud stopped at the border.
Can your wife drive?
She cracked the walnut with her teeth.
Tom thought Mary would die an old maid.
Tom wasn't the only one in the room that couldn't speak French.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
Move over, will you?
Tom wants to stay in Boston.
I would like to go, too.
The girl was overcome with grief.
Tom doesn't say much.
True happiness consists of desiring little.
You're hurting her.
These are wonderful.
I'm sick of your excuses.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Tom told us about what he did in Boston.
Keep looking for them.

Let's end this.

Have you read the notice?
Tom is a good kid.
We all noticed it.
Whatever she says, I don't believe her.
Tom is curious now.
How's Tom holding up?
There was nobody to ask.
I'd be willing to take that chance.
It's already good.
I wonder who it's from.
Why do you lie for him?
I'm going to give Tom a bath.
We need to know.
I was waiting for her.

Tom's not quite sure of that one.
I'm not sure it's a mistake to tell Tom.
He said farewell as he was about to leave.
What have we here?
Who won?
Tom tried to go back to sleep.
Tom will get used to it.
No one could see us.
You're not going to see Tom today, are you?
She said she was of two minds as to whether to go or not.
Tom shouted at Mary.
How's your daughter?
It's very cold this winter.
Tom let us all down.
The biggest problem in Tom and Mary's marriage is Mary's mother's interference.
I can get it from Tom.
We have two boats.
Are you bored here?
It's night.
The geyser sends up a column of hot water every two hours.
We have one more thing left to do before we can go home.
Keep up your courage.
She is a beginner.
You're a boor.
Tom changed my life.
We don't know how to find them.
That wasn't right.
It's not like Tom not to call.
Tom already thinks I'm crazy.
We've almost got it.
I could say the same thing.
Pray for her.
They want you dead.
How many years have you been teaching children to swim?
I hope we meet again.
Of course you understand.
Tom is spying on us.
Who's on the team?
The smoke blew away.
They're staring at you.
Tom started walking.
Tom and I are just good friends.
Mary came into the living room wearing a bathrobe.
I can handle him.
Did you see anybody?
Fuck your mom, bitch.
We are cheeping like sparrows.
It was just a rumor.
Let's find out who stole our money.
Tom saw the pictures.
I'd like to know if she's arrived.
I haven't tried doing it that way.
Stop harassing me!
I explained the process to him.
Has Tom been fired yet?
My dogs are white.
They're not moving.
You're tall, just like your father.
Trust me.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
Are there bigger carrots?
Are you in a hurry?
Tom seems shocked.
It's still breathing.
Who's first?
Tom told Mary that it would probably snow all day.
He was wet all over.
I have to get some money.
Please don't leave like this.
We've made progress.
They went surfing.
What you did was a big help.
We like playing in mud.
Tom is undependable.
Tom would tell me.
She nailed a board.
What does Tom want?
What if Tom is wrong?
I couldn't help him do that.
I still don't know what your name is.
If you guys want to sleep here, it's no problem.
I think I'm starting to understand.

I helped her do some chores.
Try this.
Leave it be, Tom.
UN stands for United Nations.
Does Tom know that you like him?
Nobody ever helps me.
This towel is rough to the touch.
I was dreaming about him.
I'll keep my promise.
Does Tom know where the others are?
Be yourself.
I fully agree.
I can't feel my legs.
Some juice, please.
Just throw it away.
I can't forgive him just because he's a boy.
What's so special?
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
He sits upright, not crouched over his plate like an animal at a feeding trough.
Are you really happy?
I really liked that movie.
Bill will return next week.
We were working late.
Science is very exciting.
I'm going to wait for them.

I'll give you half my allowance.
He earns a great deal.
There is no stopping a girl's tongue.
I need medical help.
Most people have to work for their livelihood.

You said you were concerned.
They offer free condoms.
Be passionate!
Sorry, I have church on Sunday. Let's meet early Monday morning.
What was I looking for?
Can you give her a ride home?
Tom is a liar if he says he saw us together.
We gave them some apples.
Don't you think it is rather warm for December?
You asked me to help.
Tom has nice skin.
The radio is on the table.
I can make you a legend.
Tom wasn't fat.
Go ahead, shoot me.
I know Tom isn't in very good shape.
They heard gunfire.
I was worried about him.
I lent her my camera.
I know you miss them.
Please remain seated.
Tom may know where Mary is.
The country house was complete, with a swimming pool, a barbecue, a soccer field and a pool table.
The food is spoiled.
I'm going to get myself a burger.
Tom can handle it.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
I'm late for lunch.
I don't have any more jokes to tell.
We'll continue later.
Welcome back, Tom.
That's why I wasn't able to arrive yesterday.
You should be happy.
We have to overcome many difficulties.
He likes the music.
Tom had a tough week.
The door won't close.
I've got to sign off.
How much does she need?
Tom never drinks milk.
You met my sister, didn't you?
Tom hoped that Mary would recover.
I'd like to offer you a job.
Tom's imaginative.
It is not my business.
I can't understand how Tom could know.
You go right ahead.
I'm in trouble now.
I know it seems like I'm overreacting.
Tom must've known that would happen.
I found my book.
I actually know the answer to that question.
This data supports the hypothesis.
It'll happen, I'm sure of it.
I know.
Please stay.
What was your score?
Tom's glad.
I've never seen her before in my life.
How can I trust Tom?
I'll never ever see you again.
That just might work.
You have cream on the top of your nose.
How much does he earn in a month?
We can win this war.

They kidnapped me.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
We have no more food.
It was worse.
Tom looked like he wasn't enjoying himself.
This is exciting stuff.
We're avoiding her.
This is what I want.
Why is my bag empty?
Tom won't come. He's too busy.
I need to call him.
Get off my property.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
I can't let Tom know.
You're being used.
You did your part.
I feel bad for them.
Please give Tom everything he asks for.
The old house stands on a cliff.
Don't laugh at her mistake.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Going out in this rain is out of the question.
Tom said he'll help me get everything I need.
Where was I?
The boys were whispering; I knew they were up to something.
Tom has it all worked out.
This is an elephant's tusk.
You are my pride and joy.
Don't pay attention to her.
How can you be so calm?
Tom is in the attic.
Put that box down.
I've got stuff to do.
Kissing a person who smokes is like licking an ashtray.
No one would listen.
Stay here till I return.
We need to get down to business.
Is that good or bad for him?
You're the one person I can rely on in this kind of situation.
Can you believe this?
My home lies far across the sea.
I just need my own space.
It's really confusing.
They don't want to lose any more.
Tom used to be neat.
My leg is broken.
I am woebegone.
The whole place was covered in snow.

It's a family secret.
Has Tom been sedated?

What happened?
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
I'm going back for her.

Draw a straight line.

You may go.
What's your point?

Tom called Mary back.
Let me see what I can do.

I do think this isn't good.
Are we going to eat?
Was anyone injured?
Tom said he'd like to visit Boston.
Tom stopped moving.
Tom almost fainted.
I thought that's what you needed.
I can help you out.
Mary loves to ride her horse.
Is Tom under arrest?
We've been trying.
Tom wrote something on the back of the letter.
That's not why I called you in here, Tom.

I'm scared of you.
The credit cards are plastic.
Is Tom in surgery?
Where are the files?
I couldn't wait for her.
How are the negotiations going?
The data is incorrect.
We're surrounded.
Does Tom know this?
This directly concerns them.
I fell in love with you the first day we met.
What's going to happen next?
I think he'll come.
There's a lot of tension in this room.
How would you describe them?
I brought you some ice.
We're going to find them.
Take your time, but hurry up.
It's done.
I've written to Tom suggesting that he come stay with us this summer.
I was a witness.
A tea with lemon, please.
Please get her.
I consulted them.
I walked along the river.
The forest abounds in trees.
So what's the prognosis?
The middle one is mine.
I hope you two are very happy together.
What did the boy say?
Finish to eat!
Find out all you can about Tom.
Who's your favorite Disney cartoon character?
We have to attend that meeting whether we like it or not.
Tom was always secretive.
Let's talk about old times.
Tom heard a noise and went outside to see what it was.
Tom was pulled over.
Tom is here to help.
Can I buy that from you?
Tom has been here.
It's nothing to be alarmed about.
It is already dark.
The dog is barking at him.
I didn't know you played chess.
I want to be treated with respect.
Let us go, please.
Moths are attracted by light.

Help me out.

How long did you wait?

He was accused of theft.
Tom looks trapped.
I danced yesterday. I danced before too.
The dining area is always busy.
I yelled.
Are you vegetarian or vegan?
The president seemed strong.
Are you still upset?
You do have a choice.
Why didn't you just ask her?
We could get caught.
I ate some spinach.
Tom and Mary broke up last week.
She blackmailed him.
These animals are on the verge of extinction.
I answered the phone.
Nothing scares me.
Emily hates onions.
They have hostages.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
Nothing's going to happen to Tom.
Tom could have a gun.
Bring him with you.
Tom is very timid.
Unlike what we expected, the accusations were not made.
Tom and Mary were also present.
Tom looks a bit queasy.
Tom might not be at Mary's party tonight.
Tom said you'd know.
I can barely stand up.
Mary doesn't like her mother-in-law.
Look after Tom, will you?
You people wait here.
They were after Tom.
I thought you'd already taken care of that.
Tom started playing.
Is he your teacher?
We'll meet Tom there.
No one has died yet.
Let's find another solution.
I have to take a leak.
That's so bizarre.
She disapproved of my trip to Vienna.
I'd feel happier if you three went outside again.
Should I do that?
Tom played the piano for three hours without taking a break.
I had to fire him.
The room didn't look very good after Tom painted it, because he didn't even bother to wash the walls or ceiling first.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
Don't you like my cooking?
What did you get him?
No one voted for him.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
Tom met Mary this morning.
Are you crying?
It's not my concern.
I'm just cleaning up.
Smoking may be fatal.
Tom is behind Mary.
Let's discuss it now.
Don't worry about it.
I hope they'll understand you anyway.
I am beginning to understand.
You should never look directly at the Sun with the naked eye.
It was nice of you to ask.
Were you aware that Tom is in the hospital?
What good is this?
Tom caused this.
What does it contain?
She was brutally murdered.
I'm going to take this home.
I think we'll have to help them.
I never doubted you.
Quiet down, please.
If it doesn't gross you out, you can use my spoon.
I've got Tom's address somewhere on my computer.
I forgot what Tom wanted.
This will cheer you up.
It gave me an idea.
There was no connection between Dan and the victim's family.
I came here with Tom.
You're really quick.
Let it go.
I wouldn't eat that if I were you.
We adopted them.
Tom is wearing a baseball glove.
Do we have any food?
This street runs due north.
This ugly yellow reminds me of the color of your bedsheets.
Do you think you can help him?
I can't ask him to do that.
Tom died of dehydration.
You know, we could still make it happen if we wanted to.
I was hardly able to see her.
I think we've had enough to eat.
It has to be a mistake.
We're turning back.
I asked him to help.
Don't touch it. That's mine.
Tom wasn't sure.
You look pretty down.
I'm going to do that.
What is it you like about him?
I just don't get it.
I no longer need it.
I'm going back to Boston as soon as this meeting is over.
Can we sit over there?
What'll happen to me?
Tom might not drink beer.
It never snows here.
Tom isn't wearing a tie.
Go and see if you can find him.
We cried together.
Come closer in order that you may see the screen better.
Tom has been a good friend to me.
Don't gloat.
You are my friends.
We could talk about her.
Tom advised Mary to go to the police.
You tell me that all the time.
I don't trample your wheat.
Let's ask her something else.
Tom is always around.
Tom didn't seem to be particularly interested in what was going on.
Maria acts as if she were a fool.
There are limits.
One of us could help her.
I lied to you because I didn't want to go.
Don't look.
Did you understand any of that?
Cut the crap!
It must be removed.
I have a stomachache.
I didn't pick it up.
Can we interview Tom?
I can't eat peanuts.
This isn't a game.
Tom doesn't eat fish.
Step away from the car.
It was only a joke.
Tom told me he'd do it tomorrow.
Tom lives next to me.
Please don't mumble.
My hometown is in the center of Hokkaido.
If you have something to say to me, say it.
I like Boston a lot.
How can I get there?

Is anybody in there?
I married a Canadian.
Organic compounds are generally molecular compounds.
I really want to get something to eat.
I'm going to go over to Tom's.
I'm not going to let Tom borrow my car.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his around his face.
We helped her.
Tom's dog stood up.
Tom and I aren't talking right now.
Tom and Mary just got married last year.
I cannot chew anything. I am toothless.
The baby has presumably swallowed the pacifier.
Michael is a male name and Michelle is a female name.
We partied together.
It's not finished.
Tom stood watching.
You must go to work.
All you have to do is write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
Dan told Linda that everything would be perfect.
It's time for action.
It's just started snowing.
I want to try again.
She is the goddess of orgy.
I'm not good at it.
How could we forget you?
Get their weapons.
This is probably the place.
I love my daughter.
Fasten your seatbelts.
My feet are numb.
There's no mistake.
We need to work as a team.
They have been in Brazil for one year.
We couldn't help him any more.
I must concentrate.
Where did I park my car?
Does Tom have a pet?
Cool it.
Tom said that he'd be right over.
They'll eat those.
It's been a bad week.
Where are you going, Dad?
Is Tom dead?
I'll go and get them.
Tom felt strong.
I risked everything.
Mary brushed her hair and put it in a ponytail.
Wait till I call.
I don't even have a house.
Are you about done?
Isn't it sickening?
How many credits can I get for this course?
Tom and I are brothers.
I have to say I envy you guys.
What good are those?
Not everything that can be done is worth the pain of doing it.
I'll tell you when I see you.
Tom lost his voice.
Mary denied it.
Tom works at a computer company in Boston.
Tom weighs more than Mary does.
We have a visitor this afternoon.
I have to ask him to help us.
Tom might be able to help you study for your exam.
He doesn't have his ideas clear.
He was fast asleep.
We forgave them.
Let me cook something for you.
I was disappointed.
I've decided to forgive you.
We can't give up that easily.
I met them last week.
I'll get the food.
I remember last night well.
Aren't you tired yet?
How are you not seeing that?
I'm sure I can find everything.
Get your coat.
What're you all dressed up for?
Tom is really cool.
She did not desire his death.
Tom loves to gossip.
Let's start with you.
I'm not arresting them.
I was bored.
My knee is bleeding.
I have made a most marvellous discovery.
Why do you have this?
I really do want to help her.
She knows me.
Where do pine nuts come from?
Look at me, please.
All you have to do is sit down here and answer the doctor's questions.
I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
You deserve a raise.
I was trying to kill time.
I hit Tom again.
Tom really isn't happy to hear that.
"What's that?" "This is a peach."
Tom isn't religious.
Everything is going to be different now.
I have to go to sleep.
Tom is a silly man.
I wasn't home at that time.
Before this, Mary called me to ask how the project was coming along.
Tom just got fired.
Tom found the hat Mary was looking for in the basement.
I didn't see anyone.
They met in prison.
What happened to the Sphinx's nose?
What we need is a plan.
I'm going to buy you something.
Republicans were furious.
Tom will complain.
She's my godmother.
I have a large family.
This isn't about Tom.
He was named Tom after his father.
Tom got out of the car, but Mary remained behind the wheel.
We removed the old furniture.
Tom said he didn't feel hot.
They won't come back.
Tom might be able to convince Mary to help us.
Tom asked Mary for a job.
Tom said that he'd be ready soon.
They lost everything.
Are you paid well?
He stood in awe before her.
No one did anything else.
I'm sure we could arrange that.
I came to apologize.
We'll ask him.
It's cold out here.
I like to eat a date with almonds.
Why is that a problem?
Got that?
Who stood?
Gold is heavier than iron.
I was like Tom once.
We talked about it.
It would be nice if that were so.
We're actually on our way to Boston.
One must use reason.
It feels strange.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
If I had money, I'd buy this computer.
Don't you know?
There was a strange, foul-smelling brown liquid in the waste basket.
She has no manners.
Let's make sure nothing is wasted.
I'm getting nervous.
Why don't you just ask him?
Please write your name here.
Tom is very thorough.
You aren't special.
Tom ought to have been here a long time ago.
I'll see Tom later today.
Please let me handle this.
The idea that reading makes you short-sighted has been popular for a couple of hundred years.
I'll meet Tom in Boston.
The ship changed its course.
Tom is warmhearted.
I'll call him for you.
Everything's OK now.
Everybody was silent.
Tom is really good.
What was it for?
I'm sure I'll manage.
Tom's shy.
I know you're busy.
Tom was kidnapped.
We've got to get them to help.
Don't lie about me.
Tom is big.
We don't get along.
Are you going to give Tom the money he asked for?
You can't win, Tom.
Who do you know in Boston?
Tom wouldn't talk.
What is the right time?
I have a job for you.
Do we have to help Tom?
Tom is my hostage.
Keep going.
He refused to shake my hand.
What don't you get?
Don't state the obvious.
Tom won't allow it.
It seems that it will rain.
Nobody believes me.
I can see I've lost you.
Dan landed safely.
Today was definitely shorts and T-shirt weather.
The hunter followed the bear's tracks.
He looked quite tired.
They despise her.
The group was impressed.
You have to look at me.
Jane never backs down.
Tom, what happened? Why are you crying?
Superstition is the religion of feeble minds.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.
She should be charged with murder.
Tom turned on a lamp.
He retired at 65.
Tom may not be busy.
I'm concentrating.
Well, Tom, you know how much your approval means to me.
Tom wasn't poor.
Tom has gone insane.
I've had my share of problems.
I've been careless.
Tom wants you all to himself.
I hate cops like him.
I wish I hadn't kissed Tom.
Help me find them.
Shame on you.
That'll have to do.
We'll obey.
Tom won't do that.
We're not going to Boston.
Many people hunt.
We helped them once.
Speak louder, please.
Tom asked where I was staying.
I think Tom is sensible.
We'll keep looking.
Therapy didn't work.
He claimed that he had discovered a new comet.
You need to go now.
Tom can't make it.
He gorged himself on ice cream.
I let Tom do anything he wants to.
Music is a gift from God.
I can get him to help you.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
My hands are tied.
Belgrade has about 2 million inhabitants.
She usually walks to school.
Oh, god. It's raining.
I didn't need to take an umbrella with me.
I was happy.
Tom changed.
Tom locked the door.
I've got something.
We don't know the Jacksons.
What's the matter?
Tom took out a pen and a notepad.
Tom will consider it.
I gave them a choice.
I've made so many mistakes.
Everybody laughed at her.
ׁWe have large sizes, but unfortunately not in that color.
Tom didn't protest.
I asked how you were.
Stay off the grass.
I like this perfume.
One can never be too young or too old to enjoy a certain genre of music.
It's the same old story.
Who listens to Tom?
I can't say anything.
Please turn the page.
That's no good, Tom.
It's OK to be afraid.
I'll get started on this.
It's so imprecise.
Dan apologized to Linda for being dishonest.
That's sad.
My notebook is pink.
Tom always keeps his room clean.
For me, strawberries are more sour than lemons.
You're just jealous.
Tom paused for a moment.
I didn't earn this.
You're adventurous.
I know what I said.
You can make it easier for yourself.
I can't believe we were going to shoot Tom.
What made her do so?
I want you to know I appreciate your recommending me.
Don't leave me, Tom.
I wanted to go there.
Let us in.
Do you like venison?
Just give me one, will you?
Nobody writes to me.
You need to fix this.
Tom looks satisfied.
I have to get her out of here.
Give them some time.
When do you want to meet?
My father is interested in ancient history.
Would you like me to try again?
Tom left.
Can you ask him to come in?
I can't concentrate with all this commotion going on.
There's another package for you on your desk.
The problem is that some of our bills haven't yet been paid.
I've been busy today.
Tom was furious.
What do you guys do?
He went back to Japan.
Let's call Tom and tell him we need to reschedule.
Water is a source of life.
Tom's mind was elsewhere.
She put her head on my shoulder.
Tom looks crushed.
Tom is very stingy.
Tom has to go home.
I want you to be my wife.
Devil sued God.
I said we'd find her.
These books are old.
I was so wrong about you.
It was an ambush.
I'm off to the gym.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
You're all set.
Could you give me your name and phone number?
Tom drinks a little.
What are you kids staring at?
Have you finished your coffee?
Do you know what's happening right now?
We have a new problem.
Did Tom believe it?
I almost dropped my sandwich.
I'll be back in a second.
I don't like winter.
It'd be treason.
I'll be waiting in the lobby.
Tom pushed Mary toward the door.
Tom removed his tie and unbuttoned his collar.
I'm going to Boston next week.
Did he forget his money again?
Are you conservative?
Sometimes I'm scared of the dark.
I don't believe it myself.
Tom isn't a crook.
Give her the $300.
What's the name of Tom's boat?
Ask her not to wait for me.
I saw a UFO.
Which planet are you from?
I think I shouldn't have married you.
Are you in much pain now?
I was in terrible pain.
I am in favour of your proposal.
There are no examples.
I want to tell you about them.
What's the title of the movie?
Tom hid the knife he'd killed Mary with in John's bedroom.
I have work for you.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
I'm meeting Tom for breakfast.
The islet resembled a tortoise from afar.
Barley is our main product.
Did it hurt?
I'm going to ride him until he dehydrates through ejaculating.
I couldn't kill Tom.
May I take your coat?
Push the door open.
I know exactly what you went through.
We caught him.
All my haste was in vain.
Feed that some rice.
Did you like the movie we watched yesterday?
I want to know when your birthday is.
That was all wrong.
I've been betrayed.
They married, had a family and lived happily all their lives.
I've got to tell Tom.
Why would Tom have done that?
Here are your keys.
Tom isn't very polite.
Tom went on eating.
What was Tom doing?
What should I do about them?
It's yours.
I'm your assistant.
My eyes are watering.
It snowed all day yesterday.
The TV doesn't work.
It was all a dream.
I could go there now.
They all went back.
What did you ask Tom?
We should set a trap.
I love lasagna.
Turn around slowly.
Whose are these?
I'm going to wait for him.
Tom lost his temper.
I'd better go away.
I don't like myself.
You can't be down here.
Our teacher always favours female pupils.
Don't flatter yourself.
The question is who'll do it.
Aren't you nervous?
It's five to six.
What will this buy me?
I think I'll go and get him.
Tom knew it was foolish to go out by himself after dark.
Did you see the sunrise earlier? It was really beautiful.
Tom outlived Mary.
You said you'd help them.
Tom began to get downhearted.
He went on board the plane.
How do you get on?
The forest is filled with dangerous creatures, including beasts, snakes, poisonous insects, and whatnot.
Tom didn't know that Mary was already dead.
Mary bristled with rage after Tom broke her vase.
Taro, dinner is ready.
We do not sell alcoholic drinks or cigarettes to people under the age of eighteen.
It won't be the same here without you.
Do you think we'll be able to do this without any help?
Keep speaking, because you speak well.
Is this safe to eat?
Tom seldom makes mistakes when he's speaking French.
Tom leaned over the table and kissed Mary.
Tom's resume's impressive.
I'm not your friend.
I couldn't stop staring at him.
That's his specialty.
I've used up my Q-tips.
I didn't think you'd mind.
Tom felt confused.
Is everybody happy?
Your crimes have desecrated your ancestor's graves.
Presumably, Mary watered the flowers while we were away.
One should treat his teachers with respect.
Tom wakes up early.
He was made my servant.
She came near to drowning.
I'd like to go home early today.
Tom seems to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
I don't want to go swimming.
You're going places.
That was so funny.
Watch out for her.
We're fasting.
You learn quickly.
Tom danced with Mary.
I tried not to worry.
Nothing's going on.
I'll never forget him.
Tom downed his beer.
Tom turned on the desk lamp and started working.
Tom agrees.
It's their job to figure out what's wrong with Tom.
Get her back here.
I tried to cheer her up, but she did nothing but cry.
I'll deliver the box.
We adopted a baby.
Dan didn't even throw the ball.
This is good coffee.
When did I tell you that?
Is this all we need?
She made a fuss for no good reason.
I'll miss Tom, too.
I don't know what happened, but there are feathers all over the place.
They didn't say why.
There was a guy named Tom who used to live here.
Let's fire them.
Tom can barely see.
This question seems to allow two answers.
The only evidence was the traces of semen stuck to the underwear.
It's happening again.
That's really cool.
To do as you suggest is out of the question.
Tom didn't actually ever go on a date with Mary.
Linda wore no make-up.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
I can't eat all of this.
Everybody wants Tom.
Tom is just going through a phase.
I wish we had your problems.
I chose these shoes.
Tom's eyes are huge.
Tom made fun of Mary.
Where is it located?
But why doesn't she shut up?
Did you forget to lock the door last night?
I blame Tom for that.
Why would I help him?
I don't like to be touched.
That sounds right.
I'm biased.
I like horses.
Can I have a second?
I'll take this one.
What would Tom want that for?
I'll do it again if you want me to.
We've already talked about that.
Get the box.
Hold on a minute, please. I'll see if he is in.
Tom prefers red wine to white wine.
Why did he quit smoking?
I knew I had to stop.
It is a multi-stage process.
I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon.
Does anybody really think Tom didn't kill Mary?
Mary loves playing with dolls.
How many hours do people work in Germany per week?
You know the rules.
Tom is responding well to the treatment.
I wasn't the one who wrote this.
No, I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I heard Tom sniffle.
I didn't drink any beer last night.
Everybody desires happiness.
I'm coming to Boston.
There needs to be a full stop at the end of a sentence.
I'll deal with it.
I wrote it for him.
I'm not a monster.
Tom laughs like a girl.
Can you guys keep a secret?
My father was busy.
What do you think about global warming?
He's her beau now.
Was that all Tom said?
Tom wants only one cup of tea.
This stone has a hole in the center.
It's an adventure.
He's likely to come.
I have gas.
Tom is sad, isn't he?
Andrew is fixing some shelves in the bedroom.
I'm glad it's over.
I've just seen the results.
The noise alarmed the whole town.
You really hurt Tom.
This is the decisive duel.
I want my money back.
He is playing.
We're sophisticated.
My brother is very important. At least he thinks he is.
Whose car is that?
This dog is staring at me as if it wanted to eat me.
I'm 19.
Tom gave Mary some advice on how to pass multiple-choice tests.
Tom recognized it.
Your car's on fire.
No one will hurt you.
The question is who's going to tell Tom.
I'm just making sure.
I'll decide how to proceed.
Can you recommend a good upholsterer?
Tom changed clothes.
Have faith in God.
I made a terrible mistake.
Tom got beaten up.
Tom remained in the car while Mary went into the supermarket.
Tom pried the locker open.
Mary is my best friend. We do almost everything together.
Yup, I am angry.
Tom sabotaged Mary's car to prevent her from leaving the farm.
Beats me.
Tom unsheathed his sword.
You're not so horrible.
I guess I'll just go over to Tom's.
How do you like it?
Tom seems troubled.
I'm not overwhelmed.
Take three steps and jump.
I have to go change.
I haven't got any pen.
Hand me that broom.
I hope that she will help me.
Is this a mistake?
You need to get her a job.
Who makes breakfast for her?
What do you have to say about it?
Do you wear glasses?
It's Monday.
What does it cost?
I want to leave Boston.
Should I ask him?
Tom really knows a lot about baseball.
The sand is warm.
It might be risky.
Tom is out to lunch.
It's the world's oldest profession.
That's the real reason.
Tom has never laid a hand on me.
We want you to take it.
Tom wasn't the only survivor.
I know precisely what you are feeling.
Not a soul was to be seen.
You've been trained.
Tom was embarrassed.
Tom has three kids.
I'll see you tonight at eight.
Tom told Mary why he was late.
You're pushing me.
She was very beautiful in her youth.
They found a secluded beach where they spent the day.
That sounds pretty bad.
You need to stop and smell the roses.
Did you buy these for us?
Tom tasted the cake.
Tom might've been in Boston at the same time Mary was.
I want you to find them.
Do you have any idea why Tom did what he did?
I told you to keep away.
They're not soldiers.
We have an advantage.
Give that back to me.
You lost, didn't you?
I'm looking out for Tom.
Tom will obey you.
I'm going to go to Boston.
He climbed to the peak of the mountain.
Tom is the oldest.
It's time to talk.
We don't need to talk about that.
Do what's best for him.
That's a good brand.
Tom is rude.
I may disagree with your words but I hear you out.
It was about money.
A storm is brewing.
How fast!
Tom is dead serious.
I go for a walk with my husband every evening.
Bring them along.
Land came in sight.
You have a feather on your hair.
You look troubled.
He knows no English.
What we need is a good plan.
What more can we offer?
They're clearly not happy to be here.
There's no way anyone other than Tom could've done this.
They're bothering me.
Christmas is a special holiday.
You didn't commit a serious crime.
Tom is looking ill.
I forgot about that.
Tom didn't follow.
I want to talk about them.
We want to become citizens.
It isn't wrong.
These are fresh.
I don't find him in the telephone directory.
We dislike violence.
Do I need to hurry?
Tom is a ladies' man.
Do you own a handgun?
Tom seems distressed.
There wasn't time.
Scoot over.
Although I was tired, I did my best.
If you'd eat a bit less, you'd lose a few pounds.
I am better.
You owe me a new keyboard that isn't full of coffee.
You're quite mistaken.
I was flabbergasted.
They can't get out.
Tom will need help.
Stay with us tonight.
I shouldn't have been so rude to Tom.
He does his duty.
She can jump high.
Tom's incompetent.
Hey, relax.
He returned at six.
He's a twat. I can't listen to his nonsense anymore.
He is inclined to be lazy.
I know all about her.
We followed them.
Are you helping her?
We might need to help her.
Tom wants to get married, but not to Mary.
Who was in the car?
I thought we were going to crash.
When do owls sleep?
Why would I help them?
What did Tom expect?
You're our neighbor.
I had to go back to Boston.

That wasn't very clever.
We have to escape.
Tom and I plan to have three children.
I want to be a linguist.
How easily one acquires bad habits!
I didn't realize it was you.
We can help you now.
Tom heard something.
She played a waltz on the piano.
Tom didn't say why.
Tom'll stay.
You're supposed to be helping her.
I don't want sympathy.
At least being sick gives you the perfect excuse to stay home and watch movies.
Everybody laughed except him.
I'm honest.
You did a great job.
I love my homeland.
Get a load of this.
Parrots often imitate human speech.
What's going on now?
The lamb was cooked perfectly.
I'm just about done.
I'm not in a rush.
Tom isn't up here.
Thanks for the food.
That was ideal.
Tom called to say he can't come to help.
I am wearing my silver jewelry.
Hang onto Daddy!
I haven't opened it yet.
This rope is sturdy.
She rented a four-room apartment.
This billionaire has 5 homes in 4 different countries.
He became furious.
I just wanted to help.
You won't be shot.
Thanks for asking.
Tom began to panic.
Yes, I said that murder is a sin, but I never said that sins are wrong.
We both hate her.
He is probably dead.
No, this is my son's DVD.
Linda was pregnant at that time.
Do you believe Tom's accusations against Mary?
Tom is quite tall.
I feel kind of sick.
Tom seems puzzled.
Well, I waited for you.
Take a closer look.
They're interested.
Few people have typewriters.
The boat sank to the bottom of the lake.
Tom is imaginative.
I figured you'd want to know.
We've been attacked.
She's a dog.
Sometimes I hate myself.
Do you like costumes?
Do snakes bother you?
I let you catch me.
I know your problem.
Tom realized he was in deep trouble.
I want to go to outer space.
Do you want me to do that for you?
It is up to you to finish the task.
Everything is over.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
These are my terms.
I think you know that we need to hurry.
Do it again, the same as last time.

I think Tom is safe.
How long can you hold your breath?
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
I'll be going now.
I'm a very good chess player.
I did as I was told.
I never have trouble falling asleep.
I'll put this back where it belongs after I finish using it.

Can you handle all this?
We need to get away.
We lost everything.
We have to find out.
I know how hard it's been.
They're doing fine.
Tom wants to see you in his office right away.
Get out of my chair.
Don't tell me you're quitting.
You were cheating.
She's got terrible handwriting.
Nobody wants to play with Mary.
It's a cargo ship.
You know what I'm asking.
Tom only has one shoe on.
Can I give you three a lift?
Dan came to trust Linda.
Tom acted interested.
Why isn't there anybody?
I'll scream.
Water makes up most of the earth's surface.
Mary works at a nail salon.
Nothing is missing.
I stepped in the mud.

Don't get too cocky.
I have to use the restroom.
I must know precisely what has happened.

I truly regret that.
Nothing comes easy.
Do I need a lawyer?
Where's your wallet?
Tom is looking for a job as a baker.
I'm going to give them to you.
I'm lucky.
TV's boring today.
Who're you calling now?
Nothing else is important to Tom.
I planned a party for them.
How does that affect you?
I don't need the user manual.
The meeting was interrupted.
I just want to help them.
I'm being careful.
Should we continue?
I wonder why Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
Tom owns a plantation.
Three hours is a long time to wait.
Tom, be reasonable.
She walked barefoot over the hot embers.
Tom never told me he was a cop.

Guess what I want to do.
Don't make any noise.
I have a skin condition.
I'm materialistic.
Tell me where to find them.
Tom needed guidance.
Tom says that he wants to go to Boston.
I'll be back next week.
She was laughed at.
Who wants to see me?
I've done something wrong.
How are the children?
I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.
The dog followed me.
Just give Tom a call.
What are Tom and Mary here for?
I want to know how Tom thinks.
I'll introduce you.
Energy comes from inside.
I can take the train.
Do you have a license to fly a plane?
I used to dream about you coming to save me.
You're cooperating.
We must remain here.
Don't you pass out on me.
It's not predictable.
Tom looked so funny that I couldn't help laughing.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
I lied to both of you.
You have to get him help us.
Give me your address.
Tom threw a rotten egg at Mary.
I'll call someone.
Tom didn't know what it was.

You're doing it now.
We got a break.
I don't know how the rest of it goes anymore.
I'll drive you to school.

I met him at the barber's.
Tom folded the paper and put it in his pocket.
Coffee gives you energy!
I'm waiting for her to leave.
That's my concern.
I'm celebrating.
Even though Tom is my neighbor, I don't know him very well.
Tom easily won.
Parents can pass many diseases on to their offspring.
Have you read any interesting books lately?
The boat anchored near the shore.
I don't mind paying.
The administration makes important decisions.
Tom told me I should stay home.
Tom can't stand Mary.
Tom believed in Mary's innocence.
I couldn't deny it.
It was so beautiful.
What's over there?
Do you live here?
I'm pining for him.
I'm very worried for your sake.
He likes adventures.
Why didn't someone help us?
I think you might like to go to the concert tonight.
Dan strangled Linda with a pillow case.
You are mistaken!
Tom wants to be treated like everyone else.
Can you believe it?
Where are your grandchildren?
You can't deny it.
Do you wish to speak to me?
Do you not like them?
Are you able to help us at all?
He shooed the cat.
You're going back to prison.
If it were up to me, we could still do this tomorrow
I'll call you a taxi.
I wanted to talk with you.
I'm glad you stopped by.
I'm just glad it all worked out.
I feel their pain.
Sex is one of life's greatest pleasures.
That guy annoys me.
I also became close to nature, and am now able to appreciate the beauty with which this world is endowed.
That was the first clue.
I'm supposed to be helping him right now.
Tom always gets lost.
It's badly damaged.
I need a new bicycle.
That's totally false.
We're nearly there.
Can you bring him back?
It happened more than once.
I think it's time we gave Tom a raise.
Are you sure you can't stay here?
We have PE class.
Tom always does that.
Can you do anything to help us?
The soup needs more salt.
She agreed with him.
"Do you like costumes?" "I hate costumes!"
Is she coming, too?
Did you get lost?
Why did it have to be them?
Please don't do this.
What do you really see?
I am ready.
Isn't it gorgeous?
Tom got up to greet them.
My opinion is the same as theirs.
That worked.
Tom is high.
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.
I'm expecting a call from you.
I'll admit I'm wrong.
Tom didn't answer.
Muriel just turned twenty.
He counted to 100.
Have you ordered?
I can perfectly handle a class of sixty students.
I know this joke.
Tom is disgusting.
Don't talk!
Tom said he wanted to go home and eat dinner with his wife.
One more thing. If you try anything on Mayu I'll break your spine.
I'm scared.
Tom often brings Mary with him when he comes here.
Tom looked through all his desk drawers, but he still couldn't find what he was looking for.

I agreed to help Tom.
You're the first person I told that to.
I want us to be friends.

Can't you see I'm suffering?
Boston is where I want to go.
She gave me a sexy look.
I should sue him.
I'm sober.
I hope I'm not overdressed.
Today was a tiring day.
What have we done?
You were delirious.
Don't stumble over the rock.
They were out late drinking.
All that is to be done is to wait.
This girl looks boyish.
Tom'll understand.
Judging from the look on his face, it seems that he has succeeded.
Tom's angry.
Just keep driving.
This looks delicious.
Don't fire her.
I have friends there.
Tom did it very well.
That's my signature.
You are the master of your own destiny.
I wanted her to win.
I tried to get her to tell me.
Dick had a traffic accident.
What's in these boxes?
A river flows in the valley.
Tom is a moron.
I never believed it.
Didn't you fix the pump?

Is the bath clean?
It's been a hard night for him.
Let's catch a bite.
Who do you work for?
School begins in the spring.
I hope you like this.
I'll take the chance.
Is it windy outside?
Take a bus.
Tom will catch Mary.
I didn't want milk.
I was going to have cake for dessert, but I changed my mind.
She's older than him.
No one warned me.
Owls have big eyes.
I'm not angry at him.
I'm making changes.
Hey, is that a demonic duck of some sort?
The password is "Muiriel."
I don't think I'd be that interested.
It's hard, you know.
They yelled.
I love green peppers.
Tom explained his plan to everyone in the room.
You really married that whore.
Tom wasn't in his room.
It has to be me who goes.
I knew you were behind this.
There is a waterfall above the bridge.
Let's see if we can get inside.
That was enough.

You're very good with children.
I've got a little work to do.
We were waiting for them.
Inspector Dan Anderson found no fingerprints on the hammer.
I like that, too.
How are things in Boston?
I hate long goodbyes.
You could do this.
Tom threatened them.
I'll give him a hand.
You have to stay away from her.
The school didn't take place today.
We were all asleep.
Tom will use force.
Health is the greatest gift.
It's really annoying.
Tom has two brothers who both live in Boston.
Tom ought to be allowed to talk.
Tom, be careful you don't fall in the hole.
Was he Tom?
Did you get anything?
My German friend's name is Hans.
Give me that phone.
Are you dependable?
Tom couldn't resist peeking through the keyhole.
I'll help you look for her.
Suffer pangs of conscience.
Those are my orders.
They angered me.
Please accompany me.
It's not believable.
Tom asks a lot of questions.
My pants split.
I'll be busy all week.
What web browser do you like the most?
My sister saw you in the city, but you didn't see her.
I may need a lawyer.
This is important.
I suppose you won't eat with us now.
Is that the way it happened?
That would be unfair.
They won't find him there.
Tom has got a plan.
Yesterday I myself cooked dinner.
I have a hump.
Tom and Mary won't be back for a day or two.
Maybe you'd better call them.
I boil water in a sauce pan.

She stacked the trays in the cupboard.
Half of the melon was eaten.
Why would I want my money back?
They increased the territory of the empire.
Where is the hammer?
You are in my seat.
Tom isn't your enemy.
There's nobody whose saliva doesn't stink.
They're my cousins.
I had an artificial insemination with sperm from my husband.
Go.
You didn't cause it to happen.
Let us handle them.
I am no match for him.

I'm not a bad person.
We think so.

Mary was such a lovely bride.
That didn't take them long.
Nut was the Egyptian goddess of the sky.
The boy has a huge bump on his head. No wonder he cried so much!

"Do you love him?" "What?" "Do you love him?" "That's none of your business!"
Why did you fire me?
Pump up the tire.
Can I give you the assignment?
Tom doesn't like me very much.
Did you hear the birds chirping?
Here's how we're going to win.
I've always had an interest in the paranormal.
We were tired.
Before this, I worked as a cab driver.
The lid is closed.
Tom fixed the fence.
I just feel sorry for him.
I'll finish up here.
Tom's dog is brown.
Tom hung his coat up in the closet.
We're not buying anything today.
They'll do something.
They always say they'll be on time, but they're always late.
Let him bark like a dog.
I don't like pork.
Here, let me do it.
Tom is not a rapid reader.
She will leave the hospital soon.
I hate playing cards.
I came to talk to Tom.
In spite of everything, he came.
I don't have anybody except her.
This is so relaxing.
Did you see her face?
That wasn't the plan.
Get your butt over here!
Where's my comb?
I don't have feelings for her.
Tom never recovered completely.
The show's almost over.
I'm quite certain that's the truth.
Don't stand.
You should write a novel.
Why are we hiding?
By the time Tom realized what was happening, it was too late.
I just didn't believe you.
He was allegedly seduced by her into giving the key to the vault.
We should always obey laws.
My laser printer can also scan an image.
I kept my mouth shut.
Tom grinned.
It's my bus.
I can confirm this.
I'd never let you kiss me.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
There's still some warm tea in my cup.
She's my great-grandmother.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
Does it even matter?
The people saved their country from the enemies.
You've been right all along.
Open, Sesame!
I'm in love with her.
Do you eat bell peppers?
I know how you felt about them.
I like to paint with watercolors.
I already think you're crazy.
You won't beat me.
Maybe Tom should quit before he hurts himself.
I said yes.
Tom never worried about where his next meal was going to come from.
It's wonderful.
We've got to do something.
I've been a lot worse.
I walked up the hill.
I hope you like what I made for you.
It was too much.
No good deed goes unpunished.

Where did you get these delicious apples?
I'm afraid to stay alone.
No man wants me. I'll have to become a cat lady.
I'm calling them.
I have to get to Tom.
Tom made Mary a sandwich.
You just messed up.
I love you the way you are.
Eat slowly.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Why should I wait?
Will you come or not?
I enjoy working.
You don't give up, do you?
We could not see the top of the mountain.
It's nice and warm.
I sent Tom back home.
We want more money.

You got home late last night.
We must know exactly what we're doing.
Most of the clothes that Americans wear are made outside of America.

The stars are glittering above.
Would you like some coffee or something?

Vocabulary is the basis of language.
You could've said no.
You're quite a liar.
I almost called Tom.

We didn't mean to intrude.
No one misses you.
Tom looked to Mary for guidance.
I'm glad you told me about him.
What subject are you good at?
They get on well together.
Would you like me to take a look?
I thought you had a driver's license.
Tom is by himself.
I'll get over you.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
We're introverted.
Tom has tricked us.
Tom was depressed.
Tom is very drunk.
What genres of music are you into?
Is that a serious question?
You can handle this.
I borrowed money from Tom.
Why were you looking for them?
Why doesn't Tom talk?
I told you Tom was busy.
She bought a chicken.
It is to his advantage.
Do you know what Tom does in his free time?
I'll take over from here.
If you don't have the vocabulary, grammar isn't going to help.
I'm horny.
We detest them.
Tom embraced his son.
I turned on the lamp.
Can I have a moment?
You should be there.
What's there to do?
Tom couldn't find a job.
I want to help them.
I'm so disappointed by your attitude.
There are none so blind as those who will not see.
What did he say this time?
She started from the summit.
Dad, what is the difference between the mafia and the government?
Did I scare you?
You'll feel better now.
Tom is seldom home.
Tom didn't remember.
I'll be busy until 2:30.
I plan to go to bed early tonight.
Wait somewhere else.
He lost his eyesight.
Isn't that a girl's name?
I thought I knew everything there was to know about this.
Have you kissed Tom yet?
I'm the same age as Tom.
Tom is the only one here that I know.
I won't be a minute.
I went to Norway.
Tom was going to betray me.
The plural form of 'person' is 'people', not 'persons'.
I have some good ideas, too.
Tom is good at tennis.
I haven't read the comments yet.
What's so dangerous?
You should not speak when your mouth is full.
Are you interested?
Marvellous.
I've had this happen before.
I'm sorry I was late.
You learn to appreciate your health when you are ill.
Mary does not need a walking stick when she is at home.
You're going to need a push.
I hate those things.
Tom is working at a supermarket now.
Maria's eyes lightened with pleasure.
Is anything broken?
The next question is for you.
I would say that I'm healthy at the moment, but I don't want to jinx myself.
Tom crawled into bed.
Where does the devil live?
I'm not quite sure what to do.
As soon as I can get my son to scan our family photos, I'll upload some of them to our website.
The only question is who.
Let's get Tom out of there.
This town hasn't changed a bit since the 1970's.
For fifteen days I strove to prove that.
I have no desire to try.
What's back there?
Tom wants to sell his car.
Tom wasn't able to sleep on the bus.
It's strange that people in hot climate zones eat spicy things like curry.
Tom looks distressed.
Does Tom have any family?
You can't leave a baby alone.
Were you blindfolded?
You were reckless.
Math is my least favorite subject.
The question is how to say no without making Tom angry.
Maybe there's someone else in the cave.
Don't be smug! You could have hurt yourself.
You've got to speak up.
Tom never told me why he was here.
At school, Mary ignored me and pretended that she didn't know me.
We were both silent for a long time.
Excuse me, can you lower your voice a little bit?
One must always study.
Please wrap it up.
I swear all I meant to do was to threaten Tom.
Why's it bothering you?
Who do you think helped me?
Get up out of bed.
I like math.
Who has my wallet?
Tom was brutally murdered.
His heart filled with sorrow.
I'm nothing like Tom.
I cheated on my boyfriend.
I can't believe you're graduating.
The weather is becoming cooler.
I think he has two children.
Even Tom doesn't do that anymore.
My grandfather used to love reading.
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
Do you know how to contact Tom?
I'm losing business.
I just saw a ghost.
Tom always worries about things that don't really matter very much.
I can eat it in here.
Why did it have to be you?
Let's find the others.
No one came.
I didn't expect I'd find them.
Looking out of the window, I saw a rainbow.
Everyone except Tom is already here.
Tom left just a while ago.
Life is crazy.
You can feel safe here in the house.
I'll come at once.
When did I ever lie to you?
Don't look so upset.
I'm the one who gave her that.
I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
Where's the blouse I bought you?
You take this one.
They're both artists.
I'm irreplaceable.
I really like being alone.
I tried to get Tom to come.
I recorded our conversation.
Tom was utterly humiliated.
Tom wants a sandwich.
There shouldn't be any problems.
Tom was scared stiff.
They were always good friends.
It's really annoying.
You should go help them.
How long'll that take?
Something is wrong.
It is very dark.
Tom isn't anything like Mary.
Start here.
The collar chafed her neck.
I'm going to go check on Tom.
Let's just get this done.
That would be a shame.
I don't think you realize what you've done.
There's no way I can catch him.
He kept on singing.
What don't you like about us?
I thought you'd stopped dating Tom.
He was badly wounded.
'Radioactivity' is a chemical term.
I do worry.
You should have killed them when you had the chance.
What would Tom do in my position?
I should've asked you first.
That day, too, I made a friend - of a sort.
No words can express how amazing you are.
Are you American?
Don't you want to talk to me?
What grade is Tom in?
I haven't achieved anything yet.
I don't like writing.
The concert concluded with the national anthem.
I have many friends who are native speakers.
She must have been gorgeous when she was young.
Tom wanted to travel.
She wanted to help them.
We can deal with it.
I want to work in Boston.
Tom was very thirsty.
Tom rarely goes out.
It must've been her.
Why is the store closed?
I got a call from them.
It's unusually ugly.
Christ is risen!
Why is it important to save money?
You wanted to change it.
Stay in this room.
His mother made him clean the bathroom.
Which factory was it?
Those apples are big.
Check your order.
She has a black puppy.
I'm still waiting.
He can't be trusted.
Tom was really good.
It is better to be stung by a nettle than pricked by a rose.
He is studying hard.
These must be fake.
Left outside the freezer, the juice will get warm.
I'm enjoying the process.
We are puppets to the gods.
Don't make me blush.
I called from Tom's house.
I didn't know anyone else was awake.
Why didn't you go back for them?
You'd better go help him.
I'm not going, and that's that.
Can anyone help me?
They started the meeting without me.
You should do anything that is necessary to be happy.
That's why you should hire me.
Don't send me away.
Please stay inside.
Tom searched the kitchen drawers.
I've never been on a ship before.
I don't know how to help him.
I'm so glad.
We don't have to worry about any more interruptions from Tom.
It's time we got ready.
The croaking frogs inspired tremor in Mary.
I've got many of those.
A candle without a wick is no candle at all.
People have become so rotten!
Tom is Mary's father-in-law.
The coat is lined with fur.
I'm just telling you what I found.
It's an important step.
There was something there.
I've actually never played golf.
Are they talking about him?
That's why I'm happy.
No cannons, no oil.
I can sense how angry you are.
Where did Tom say Mary had gone?
Look out for him.
I'm sure Tom misses you, too.
Wait in the lobby.
Tom appears unhurt.
Tom refused to pay.
Has anyone found them yet?
I know what Tom said.
Why would you want to buy that?
Why are the lights off?
The flowers were swaying in the wind.
There must be a balance between chaos and law.
Tom doesn't let anyone touch him.
Thank you for bringing Tom.
I think you're both right.
Your car has been repaired now.
We're helping them out with something.
What were your teachers like?
It'll soon be sunset.
Are you here alone?
The heart is a muscle.
Why should I do that?
I've failed.
I know your brother.
Everyone was alert.
It's weird.
I am thrilled to be here.
Tom found it more and more difficult to ignore the pain.
I'd better go study.
Has anybody heard from them?
Tom was walking down the street, whistling a tune.
Give me your money.
The police found Linda's shirt in Dan's room.
How long do we have?
Who appointed Tom?
You have to defend yourself.
Tom found out what Mary did.
Tom didn't complain.
I accept the offer.
We didn't find Tom.
Is breakfast ready?
They're useless now.
Who said I was wrong?
Tom is very artistic.
We can do nothing for you.
Keep your hands off her.
I already read all the Harry Potter books.
We'll see you around.
We don't hate them anymore.
Dry sand absorbs water.
Tom is thirty-one.
Is this tofu?
I should call you.
I'll grab your bags.
Mary overheard Tom talking intimately to another woman on his mobile phone.
He looks just like a skeleton.
It takes me a lot of time in the morning to get ready for work.
It's been a while since I've eaten anything with mustard.
Maybe you should ask them.
You have lovely breasts.
It was remarkable.
Dan entered the courtroom.
I eat some cheese.
I live in a remote area.
I heard you arguing with them.
Dan is determined to stay here, no matter what.
My plan is working.
We could've managed.
I need you to do something for me.
Please leave the notebooks on the table as they are.
I'm glad you didn't call them.
They're not busy at all.
Let's take it easy.
We'll all be there together.
He lay without movement.
The words confirmed him in his suspicions.
Meat or fish?
Tom appears stunned.
He might not be happy.
Impressive, isn't it?
We'll help you look for them.
Tom loves sunsets.
Tom bought a webcam.
Tom won't respond.
Mary kicked Tom in the groin.
Tom sealed the room.
There's a possibility that I'll be killed.
Tom always keeps his room neat.
What does Rossiyane mean?
Life is like a soap bubble.
How did you come here?
We have direct access to the information.
I quit smoking two years ago.
You're after her.
Tom is a renowned chef.
Thine eyes are as doves.
Did Tom eat anything?
You need to buy them presents.
Tom often cuts class.
Bring me my clothes.
Tom is in his office.
I should get packed.
It matters.
Tom looked at the horse.
This pear smells nice.
Perhaps we should contact her.
Tom will keep you company.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the supermarket to buy some milk.
I'd like some help, please.
But always pleasure is accompanied by pain.
Recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
I'll never forget them.
Somebody set him up.
On May 30, we will know the results of the election.
He didn't go and I didn't either.
Take the next one.
You should have your eyes examined.
I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
Look at what I made.
Tom is very chatty.
He got his nose pierced.
He married a stewardess.
You did it!
People are talking.
She went to Germany to study medicine.
Poppycock.
Don't you like Tom?
There are only books on the bookshelf.
I honestly didn't know that Tom didn't know any French.
Tom doesn't have a fever this morning.
Tom says he didn't hit Mary.
Why didn't you try calling me?
I'm useless.
I was in Boston last week.
Never forget that.
That was so creepy.
You make me laugh a lot.
We need to hire someone to take care of this problem.
They're fools.
Put your clothes on the bottom shelf.
As long as they're not doing it in public, let 'em go for it.
This is his horse.
The door was locked.
I just want to find out what happened.
That doesn't help.
Tom seems quite busy.
Nobody is speaking.
I have a warrant for Tom's arrest.
Can we please drop this?
He is an absolute monarch.
Dan harassed Linda with continuous calls.
We are men.
He sang off key.
It's not pertinent.
They're very poor.
Everyone felt sorry for him.
Tell Tom to get in here.
I recently met Tom.
I'll find somebody.
Tom's memory's getting worse as he gets older.
Tom's not in a good mood.
Tom seems serious.
I didn't know about him.
Tom skipped school.
Oh, woman, you are the best wizard in the world!
I'm not a slut!
Hang on!
They already knew.
The people resisted their cruel ruler.
They are exhausted, aren't they?
It's not raining yet.
I'm very embarrassed.
Tom told me he was not at all interested in going to the museum with us.
What are they doing?
That's surprising.
I know who you're talking about.
It wasn't on sale.
I got your address from them.
I am giving Tom a last chance.
I hear you're moving back to Boston.
We're nowhere near ready.
Tom has gone to the swimming pool.
I will go to the beach.
It usually happens very quickly.
I've been searching for them.
We've made progress.
I'm not a beggar.
This is his car.
Your boots are ruined.
I'd like to help, but I've got a plane to catch.
I think I've forgotten my wallet.
I'm not very patient.
Tom looks doubtful.
I don't need a car.
I believe that answers your question.
We are breathing pure air.
You weren't alone.
It doesn't belong there either.
I don't even own any tools.
I was pretty hungry.
My doctor told me that I needed to lose some weight.
I can't say for sure.
I must be hallucinating.
We don't have much.
I asked Tom to stop.
Who are the judges?
We'll see you get paid.
Do you want a tray with that?
Last night I was at home.
Two coffees, please.
Let's not have that happen again.
You'll get them back.
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
Who invented dynamite?
Tom remembered Mary quite well.
Let's give them some privacy.
He's shorter than Tom.
I can't just give you this.
We were really cold.
I should've anticipated that this would happen.
Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow.
Dan was promoted at his job.
He had access to the papers.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
Tom wants Mary to learn how to play the trumpet.
Jonathan Swift would defend me.
What was the nature of the relationship between Tom and Mary?
We knew you'd come.
It's great to see you so happy.
We'll contact him.
This country is a leading importer of oil.
That's a good school.
Talk to my lawyer.
I'll be right back.
What's gotten into you anyway?
What is it with you and them?
There's not much I can do for you now.
Tom has a nice watch.
Tom stayed at his uncle's house.
Is this your first time here?
Let's go ask him.
What's your address?
Tom is staying at a motel while his house is being painted.
Don't bite your nails.
I am not afraid of you at all.
The knife is dull.
Tom fooled all of us.
Tom's left arm is in a sling.
Tom isn't a good writer.
Tom looked under the couch.
Tom is intolerant.
This task requires dexterity.
Tom thinks I stole the money.
I'm not desperate.
Tom seems determined.
This is a message for you.
I'm not asking her.
Tom wanted to have a bigger house than his neighbor.
I heard it thunder in the distance.
Are you going to call them?
Do you have a theory?
We're pretty good.
Tom had expected something quite different.
There must be more.
The way you did it was wrong.
Tom had an accident at work.
Tom has a bad cold.
Tom won't eat that.
Tom cradled the baby in his arms.
These were people who fought for money.
I know you have it.
That's Tom's home.
Do you want to play tennis with me this afternoon?
I'm in a lot of pain.
You owe me nothing.
If you don't act like a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
Tom shook Mary awake.
We've got to talk.
You just missed Tom.
I shouldn't eat food that has sugar in it.
I'm sure Tom will never forget it.
Just keep walking.
The queen visited the museum.
Tom was really angry.
You should head west.
This is my sister.
He's always clowning in class.
Will you take me home?
Tom is intolerant.
Tom is the teacher's pet.
We're dizzy.
This is a major crisis.
The nurse gave Tom a flu shot.
I actually think it is a very good idea.
That's very cruel.
They were going to hang him.
I think Tom is lucky.
The ground started to shake and the alarm rang.
We didn't break in.
We're not speaking.
The chimpanzee is an intelligent creature, capable of solving simple problems.
Calm your nerves.
We're supposed to be helping them.
She put the ring on her finger.
I don't have enough money to buy everything we need.
The sheets were changed yesterday.
Well, I have some news.
I know who took Tom.
Now I'm fairly healthy again.
Don't lie about them.
Did you enjoy your weekend?
In my country the customs are different.
Tom wanted some fresh air.
Mary showed Ken another fortune teller.
Shouldn't we try and help him?
Tom is whining.
I think this'll work.
Who told you I would help you?
Sooner or later, someone has to speak up.
I knew you wouldn't help us.
Did I hear you right?
That's a good guess.
He stopped talking.
Just relax a moment.
Have you tried the chicken?
That's a very enlightened attitude.
We could've done it by ourselves.
Everything's wrong.
Tom confronted Mary.
Tom told Mary where everything was.
You're never around.
Almost every day he goes to the river and fishes.
Will you talk to Tom?
It's Tom's.
It was serious.
I promise I'll try.
What made Tom mad?
Do you come from another planet?
I promised to read the report carefully.
I dreamt about you.
Tom should take better care of his children.
Now's a bad time.
Tom tried to leave.
You would love it.
I'm not bringing it.
Tom looked in the drawers.
I thought that my father was going to kill me.
You've been gone for so long.
I'm over the shock.
We already know the truth.
It was nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
I'd better ask Tom.
This is the house they bought.
Tom's the best.
We're both named Tom.
They may need help.
Mom's at work.
Tom unfolded the map.
You're very lonely.
Get her over here.
I've got to get him to help.
Tom knows that he was wrong.
I'm trapped in here.
What a queer story!
What can I do to help him?
I leave you, fellow-thinker.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen!
Are you coming back for me?
Now we're in trouble.
I was disgusted.
I'm doing my laundry.
You can't take that away from me.
Why are you washing your hands?
If you want to cry, cry.
We'll contact Tom.
Where is the giraffe?
What are you holding?
Tom has three nieces.
You get the next one.
Why are people here?
Tom is barely conscious.
Tom started reading.
The glass is broken.
I left around 2:30.
He collapsed at her feet.
The middle finger is the longest.
There are exceptions.
I drew a moustache on Mary's picture.
The bridge collapsed.
She gave up smoking.
Try to put yourself in her shoes.
He's making the kind of face you want to punch.
I'm making scrambled eggs.
They'll like that.
Everyone believed you.
Cancer is a great enemy of mankind.
I want to be back in Boston.
I really want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember that night?
We're really drunk.
You don't have to lecture me.
Consider my request.
Tom accepted our offer.
He is a teacher.
It was great talking to you.
Tom denied nothing.
We need to turn back.
I've never been to Micronesia.
It might not just be a coincidence.
I've been looking all over for my shoes.
We have a community with wonderful people.
Ghosts don't exist, get that through your head.
Mary became a nun and opened an orphanage.
Forgive us.
I don't accept that.
Vampires live forever, unless they're killed.
He's my stepfather.
It didn't take too much time for us to finish the project.
Tom is good at rugby.
They'll ask him.
Do Germans and French hate each other?
We came in together.
How do babies breathe when they're in the uterus?
If I don't go, who will?
Pay attention!
Dan wasn't reacting normally.
I will go on a trip.
French is the only foreign language that Tom knows.
Tom knocked again.
I still don't know why you did it.
Dan bailed Matt and Linda out.
You give me so much.
I know I'm going to die.
Tom is having a rest.
I totally forgot that today is even a holiday.
It's not my decision.
Very little is known about this dangerous phenomenon.
Don't say anything.
I bought nine flowers.
Let me get you some wine.
Tom looks innocent.
You're just scared.
Sorry, we don't have any vacancies.
Tom sings quite well.
I'm going to give Tom a copy of the book I wrote.
Tom gave Mary all of his money.
Tom took three deep breaths.
My father is here.
I swear it was her.
Tom looks hesitant.
Tom doesn't care, but Mary does.
Tom poked the fire with a stick.
She will be a teacher.
The other day I ran into Meg in Kyoto.
You'll have to go.
Tom may or may not be telling the truth.
It is on me.
Brown is our English teacher.
He retired at the age of 65.
Is that the truth?
You make us feel old.
Algebra is my favorite subject.
The tip of the knife is sharp.
Everyone was tense.
You're digging your own grave, Tom.
I wish I was pretty.
I never betrayed you.
Mary was desperately in love with Tom.
And please, no chestnuts!
I got dizzy.
Esperanto is a small language, but...it keeps on growing.
Tom has already begun studying French.
Come on, Tom, I need a little cooperation.
I am embarrassed.
Tell Tom I need some money.
Tom will find them.
Tom never apologized.
Rose was blowing bubbles.
I don't think Tom knows where I live.
You never showed up.
Why do you want Tom?
That's a tower.
Tom, look who's here.
Worrying is a waste of energy.
Let's hope we're not too late.
Tom can't write yet.
I can't forget them.
I'm correct.
Is the window open?
They're out of town.
Am I clear?
Tom was often teased in school.
Mary could not stop looking at the picture of Sleeping Beauty that Tom had drawn.
Tom is an experienced sailor.
Tom is swimming laps.
Don't contradict me.
We hardly even talk anymore.
So what do you think?
Tom is supposed to be helping Mary.
Now it's your serve.
Tom said that he and Mary are planning to go to Boston next summer.
The crowd was screaming.
We had some words this morning.
The police are looking for us.
I thought you'd want to go to Boston with Tom.
I thought you might feel like going out for a drink.
We all work too hard.
Somebody invited me to have sex and I agreed.
We have seen no one.
What could it mean?
It failed.
I'll give them back.
That's when everything changed.
We'll be OK.
I'll be waiting for them.
A stench emanated from the rotting corpses.
I think it's possible that we may win.
I completely forgot about you.
Did we win?
My parents died when I was a baby.
The country demands social justice.
We can't afford to be choosy now.
He made a gesture with his hand.
Do you need me to do anything?
I baked some cookies.
Do you want a drink of water?
Tom seems to be miserable.
Admitting what you say, I still think you are wrong.
I'm an eighth grader.
I just gave them one.
Tom burst into tears.
That shovel costs thirty dollars.
Tom is good.
Tom didn't talk to Mary, did he?
You don't have to patronize me.
I can make it work.
It's almost ready.
Someone attacked them.
Tom is good for nothing.
Of course, I know what you mean.
Tom raised his voice.
The police found shoe impressions at the crime scene.
They traveled by car.
Draw me a sheep!
I won't give up, Tom.
Tom sounded as excited as Mary did.
Calm your nerves down.
This is a silver coin.
Tom said he saw Mary at the movie theater with John.
This will have to do.
That is my school.
We have guests.
Put the thermometer under your arm.
The noise is deafening.
Tom picked up one end of the couch and looked under it.
Prices are going up.
I went to med school.
Come here this minute.
I've missed you, too.
What did you get them?
I find her irresistible.
Which one is right?
Tom handed me the binoculars.
Tom couldn't speak French.
Call me right away.
I knew it was a possibility.
Stay with Tom now.
I don't have the time or the inclination.
I didn't see any children playing on the swings.
We care about you.
We'd be happy to cooperate.
I think about him all day.
The charges were false.
Stop joking.
We'll take you home.
Can't we get them to stop?
Did you enjoy that?
Where can we park?
They need to study.
She's completely crazy.
Where on earth were you, all this time?
Somehow, Tom knew.
All is quiet again.
It's worth a shot.
How did you get it?
Tom looks different.
Tom recommended Mary.
Why did you dislike them?
It just doesn't happen that way.
That girl who's wearing a scarf is a virgin.
He aspired to be a famous actor.
The dress fits you very well.
He knows how to fish with a fishing rod.
I want you to relax.
I'll look into it right away.
The butcher is cutting the meat.
We only kissed once.
Tom is making faces.
They stayed friends.
I saw several women riding their bicycles.
This is complete madness!
Mary put her head on Tom's shoulder.
My school has a band.
I'm going to hit the gym.
What's keeping you?
Let's not get carried away.
What would be the point?
Take your positions.
We're not criminals.
You sing like an angel.
This seems wrong.
We'll stay and fight.
Just say yes or no.
I know that I can count on you.
I'm not getting enough help from Tom.
I'm too busy next week.
It was a good example.
Tom might not want us to help him.
Why's the restaurant closed?
Is it difficult to learn Chinese?
Tom was all worn out.
I'm not quite well.
It didn't come up.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
Examine it.
My neck hurts today.
It's done!
I fired him.
Mary and Alice look like sisters.
Do you agree with what he wrote in the book?
I'm just trying to be kind.
Tom and Mary are no longer married to each other.
Tom wanted Mary to tell him what to do.
Tom asked Mary to scoot over.
Give, and it will be given to you.
Tom doesn't know anybody here.
What kind of threat do terrorists really pose?
I'll ask Tom for you.
I knew you'd be busy.
Let's just go inside.
They're building a new square.
I know all about the party.
Tom wasn't expecting something this bad to happen.
It can make some people, especially elderly people and infants, very ill.
Tom was a good man.
This report seems to be incomplete.
I need your help clearing this table.
Are you falling for her?
I'm really serious.
We've all got ears.
I'll find out for you.
You dialed the wrong number.
He has a chubby face.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom won't give in.
Tom is the only person who can probably help us do that.
Why don't you thank your wife a little?
Stop that.
Tom rocks.
Do you recognize anything?
Tom apologized today.
Tom started to laugh.
Mary visited her grandmother.
I want to ask you about him.
Tom didn't answer Mary's question.
In our factory, goods are produced.
You're just lying.
What's your favorite brand of soap?
Don't play with fire.
I don't need any counseling.
Why didn't you help her?
No one was helping.
I'd be willing to pay.
I met Tom backstage.
I'll do what I can to help.
Tom tripped and fell.
A screen divided the room into two.
You left your headlights on.
I failed miserably.
Thank you for letting me speak with Tom.
This world is a valley of tears.
The Pacific is very wide.
I'll ask him tomorrow.
Old habits die hard.
Don't you ever question anything?
The well ran dry.
Nobody's going to try anything.
Humanity has never had it so good.
It's hard, isn't it?
Can't we start over?
I'll get the book.
Tom swept the floor.
Can I see your hands?
Is there something you want to buy?
They left together.
You may use my typewriter.
These lines meet at right angles.
Where do comets come from?
I'm glad we're all in agreement.
I'm glad you didn't call Tom.
We'll be there soon enough.
The soldiers abandoned their camp.
He is unable to do it.
I can't speak for him.
Who gave her that recipe book?
Tom must love you very much.
I'm not trying to stir up trouble. I'm just telling you what I heard.
I'll eat standing up.
Was anybody killed?
Don't be a moron.
I feel very chilly.
This camera is cheap.
That's so pathetic.
How about we meet tomorrow?
When was the last time you went to an art gallery?
She is devoted to sport.
Cross the bridge.
This road is a dead end.
I thought you might be in Boston this week.
The store is already closed.
Do you have blankets?
We've finally reached the summit.
She lives like a princess.
I'll be traveling in Australia for three months.
Is this your family's cat?
Tom started getting impatient and frustrated.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Don't call him.
When would be best?
I can't go with you.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
Tom deserves to win.
That's his.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lived across the street from him.
What did you eat for dinner?
He's making his children sick with his cigarette smoking.
Lucky, weren't they?
Call if you need anything.
Tom loves his job.
We're workaholics.
Were you able to find her?
It's not cool.
I asked them to keep quiet.
It's windy.
The child was taken care of by him.
Tom smiled back.
Everything's gone wrong.
Tom is half asleep.
I want you to drive to Boston.
I bet Tom has never even been to Boston.
Don't walk out on me.
She ditched me.
The town was deserted.
His favourite pastimes were hunting and golf.
I totally understand.
This isn't a real diamond.
Tom left a detailed message on Mary's cell phone.
There's no time for questions.
I don't agree with him at all.
Correct the mistakes.
I don't find a formula.
She isn't new.
Can I meet you there?
I've got a flat tire.
Please, don't drive so fast.
They passed away and left me.
He lit another cigarette, but immediately put it out.
It isn't a secret.
Tom can't go out because he has a lot of homework.
I offered to help him move.
My headache is gone.
You already thanked me.
That's where I sit.
Tom won't find out.
Is what Tom said true?
Tom and Mary are asleep in bed.
We'll stick together.
It's yours.
What will happen will happen.
May I borrow a pen?
Tom is a good writer.
I need a long rope.
My name happens to be Tom, too.
I think that this work is tiring.
Why do you hate him so much?
Who was your French teacher?
Tom seems gullible.
I subscribed to a newspaper.
I feel the same way you do.
This drink is very delicious.
I don't really have any plans.
I missed my chance.
Who's this oddball?
I met Tom at church.
We should celebrate Halloween together.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and fled toward the window.
I'm pretty sure I won't see Tom again.
Are you going to sit with her?
Tom tried to sleep.
This apple is bad.
I have a big family.
I cannot scare the birds away. I am not a scarecrow.
It's my only hope.
Just close your eyes.
Tom is parking the car.
Get me Tom on the phone.
Let's have a little fun with it.
Tom's room is a real mess.
We spoke of several issues.
I'm glad you're safe.
Does your wife know?
Tom has good reflexes.
He seized me by the wrist.
I'd like one stamp, please.
It could be cancer.
I want to go faster.
I'm canceling class next week.
A question that children commonly ask is: "Where do the holes in the cheese come from?"
Are they going to arrest them?
I'd like to get this working again.
How was that?
Tom keeps a diary.
Why are you so sure?
I'll go home and get it.
You'd better hurry.
That's ironic.
Tom is my neighbor, but I don't know him very well.
The rights of the individual are important in a free society.
That's what I'm doing here.
The kidnappers blindfolded her.
You've got to apologize to Tom.
Tom suspected it might be a trap.
I tried to call Tom back.
It seems interesting.
He said that he was tired and that is why he'd like to go home earlier.
I knew I should've married Tom.
What's your favorite soda?
You need us.
The clock stopped.
Tom ought to have been a cop.
I ran out of money.
Tom and I'll be here all week.
Tom set me up.
When did you return?
I'm delighted to see you again.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
It was too much for her.
Originally they were farmers.
If there is such a thing as an unforgivable act, it is the act of not forgiving.
Where's the remote?
There's so much more I need to say to you.
She cleaned out all of the kitchen cupboards.
It's good to see you safe and sound.
That's quite common.
I want to make amends for my behavior.
I have gained weight.
Tom used to be my roommate.
Internet is very slow.
And what will be the result of that?
Tom and Mary aren't here right now.
We know so little about you.
Tom told Mary to behave herself.
There is your bag.
Tom put the car into gear.
Who asked your opinion?
Weapons export was prohibited.
Can the baby walk?
I hear you bought a new car.
You're impossible.
Tom is a complete idiot.
Tom wants you to know what he can do to help.
Don't be so demanding.
I want to enrol in a course.
Do you think you're loveable?
Tom started groaning.
Tom might object.
I gave that order six hours ago.
There are no survivors.
You're an odd one.
I'm sorry, but we're closed.
Tom is still worried.
I'll get it back from them.
Tom is being a jerk.
Don't you ever laugh?
It was a temptation, Mary, and you succumbed.
We laughed.
Tom said he had no idea where Mary was.
Everyone's looking at him.
Bill is quite reserved.
Dan believed that the hammer was the murder weapon.
Come back soon.
What kind of funeral do you want?
That's what I was doing.
Just let him do his thing.
Mary isn't only prettier, but she gets better grades than Alice.
Tom deserves admiration.
They cost too much.
The faster, the better.
That leaves us no choice.
Why are you defending them?
It is because light travels faster than sound that some people look brilliant before sounding stupid.
He's now on the boat.
Go ahead and open it up.
We took care of that.
I take my hat off to him for his hard work.
She avoids me.
I must have parked my car elsewhere.
I have a theory about her.
We're really late.
I have an open mind.
There's no concrete evidence against Tom.
I'm on the balcony.
That river seems shallow, doesn't it?
We have some ideas.
My father is a silent person.
I tried to get you to stop.
Tom must be tired.

I'm out of breath.
Dan bought Linda a nice little present.
He frotted against the mattress.
I just turned thirty.
Is it still far?
Tom looks very tense.
His thoughts are extremely academic.
Slaughter is the best medicine.
Did I invite you?
Maybe you'll succeed.
I can't get an answer from him.
He's a citizen of China.
I'm not mad at Tom.
Where's my notebook?
That's the spirit!
Tom blames me for everything.
The matter is closed.
I want to eat.
Hello! I'm a new user.
Of all the languages I've studied, French was the easiest.
Who is knocking on the door?
Something very strange is going on here.
You dropped your pencil.
Tom might just have been repeating what Mary told him.
I'm here looking for Tom.
So many languages, so little time...
What's all the fuss?
I'll deal with that for you.
Stop it.
Maybe Tom just doesn't like you.
Tuck your shirt in.
Where have you been, anyway?
Let's go shopping.
I guess you didn't get my message.
Please contact us.
I know the history of Europe very well.
That's what counts.
What did you eat this evening?
You've got to work together.
Mary wants to bring mammoths back to life.
What can you do for us?
You're the cool one.
We need it now.
Letting Tom go wasn't an option.
OK, I'll be right over.
Tom knows my number.
He writes very quickly.
Tom tossed Mary a rifle.
That's what I've been saying all along.
He lost his eyesight.
It's from the Bible.
The room was illuminated with red lights.
Tom doesn't look very healthy.
They fell.
The dog barked at them.
If you want to go to the art museum, take this bus.
Rest here for a bit.
Put the seat back.
There was a dead silence.
The room is furnished with two beds.
Your moon is returning.
Tom didn't give Mary any advice.
You'll have to learn to sit still.
It wouldn't be fair.
I'm expecting you.
This isn't the right moment. May I call later?
Are you teasing me?
Have you finished writing that song you've been working on?
Tom did it carefully.
One of the boys suddenly ran away.
What does that mean, anyway?
Tom used to smoke.
Tom doesn't say much.
I don't believe you've met Tom.
Tom got that right.
I'm keeping an eye on you.
What are the five senses?
I'm leaving.
I don't live far from here.
This job is beyond my ability.
The hunter put ammunition in the gun.
Tom told Mary this would happen.
She stood very close to him.
Maybe I should go help you.
I am a teacher, too.
You've got to come out now.
He framed the picture he had bought on the street.
What's under the blanket?
Could we have a fork?
We'll convince them.
You're sick.
How do you feel about her?
They'll come looking for him.
I'm moving.
Mary usually wears bright red lipstick.
I'll go and tell Tom.
He felt a sudden pain.
You can eat as much as you want.
Do you not play tennis?
You haven't changed your mind again, have you?
Tom stammered.
Tom used to eat meat.
I think I'm in love.
We packed everything.
Don't make a sound.
We've done what we can for them.
I must go home.
They will have placed the billboard on that building's facade before July ends.
Tom is moving away.
I'm no liar.
Pigs are even-toed ungulates.
Tom didn't laugh.
Boston is where I want to be.
I find your arguments illogical.
Only she can use this computer.
Tom believed that nothing bad could happen to him.
They live next door.
Is this about them?
Mary is a Turk.
Let's put the Christmas tree here.
We haven't failed.
Stop that nonsense.
We think you can tell us where to find him.
What causes websites to lag?
We don't know what the future holds for us.
I've learned to trust them.
I didn't apologize.
I'm seeing Tom again on Monday.
He was embarrassed.
What makes you think I don't like Tom?
I can relate to that.
I waited outside for you.
Tom has chickens.
It's quite possible that Tom won't be at the meeting.
Let's study English.
Good morning!
What do you have against him?
I don't think Tom and Mary have anything in common.
It seemed pretty quiet.
The room is a mess.
I don't see any reason for rushing.
You're imagining it.
What's your analysis?
I just kissed Mary.
My favorite subjects in high school were geometry and history.
Is Tom going somewhere?
Don't talk about him like that.
Polyglots are sexier. Talk to us.
Could you come back here again tomorrow at 2:30?
I envy you.
Where's your money?
That's really good.
We met at the church.
How do you make a box?
I have two brothers.
Tom is going to win.
Work makes everything possible.
I can wait for another hour.
It was a warm summer night.
Tom might not be able to help us.
Tom isn't shy at all.
Tom says he's very rich.
I think you've lost your mind.
This is sabotage.
I guess that works.
What does that mean?
Tom said he slept well last night.
Let's not do that right now.
The city was rebuilt after the war.
Our group consisted of five persons.
Tom stayed at a cheap hotel when he visited Boston.
He didn't understand anything.
Tom will be furious.
So what did Tom say?
I just got promoted.
I've been doing some checking.
I want to work here.
Is that so strange?
We're already late.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom isn't helping.
He is doing very well considering he lacks experience.
You might see me there.
You shouldn't try to do everything by yourself.
Tom had to go back to Boston.
You can see me, can't you?
Is that why I'm here?
I know how you feel about us.
It started glowing.
I don't have a sword.
An eagle flies in the sky.
You'll bounce back.
You know how Tom is.
Please don't be sad.
Tom became a hero.
Tom watched Mary silently.
Tom is never here.
We're all with you.
I love you very much.
That's pretty nice.
We used to spend hours there.
Is this everything?
The guard grabbed him.
Tom looked a lot like you.
Let's get them to bed.
Tom phoned.
Tom is hardworking.
Tom opened the hood.
I always liked Tom.
Why didn't somebody help me?
It's difficult to get a job at the moment.
Tom shivered.
You really should keep your promises, Tom.
Let's talk about that right now.
You need to decide.
You were almost killed.
I bought that book for them.
There was no need for you to kill Tom.
Mary is passive-aggressive.
The sentence is not grammatically accurate.
Keep this product out of children's reach.
Can I have a bite?
Linda has vanished and no one really knows with whom she ran off.
The gathering will be large if the weather is good.
That would appear to be correct.
Tom used to like baseball.
That was an illusion.
Look in the mirror, pal.
This tooth has to have a filling.
I felt threatened by them.
I respect the decision you made.
He is a doctor by profession.
You need to follow the rules.
Why don't we all go out to get something to eat?
Those are too big.
He cannot have been ill.
You must be vaccinated against rabies.
He paused to look at the poster.
Tom has published many papers on the subject.
We saw everything.
Why would you need it?
I am woebegone.
I'm not going to talk to you about this right now.
I'm late for work.
I should give her a call.
I will go.
I'm still not sure how I feel about Tom.
Tom has promised to help us.
Do you know anybody who can teach my kids French?
He should apologize for being rude to the guests.
This way.
What should we do with these holey socks?
Don't lie to me.
I never claimed that I could speak French.
Are you telling me Tom has something to do with that?
It's not going to be easy to decode.
I felt kind of sorry for her.
The system is rotten.
I almost wish I were going to Boston with you.
I've been doing some thinking.
Tom didn't want to put on weight.
The girl has a scarf around her neck.
You have to stop Tom.
I gave them no choice.
Did I really say I loved you?
Go get me a sweater.
Slow down. It's not a race.
I need you to make a phone call.
I've only had one boyfriend.
I'm leaving at 2:30.
I must tell Tom that.
Let's just get them out of here.
We found it.
I tried to warn Tom.
Show me some others.
If you'd kiss me, I'd be happy.
I hope you're not hurt.
The government turned down the request.
Socialism or barbarism.
Rats are small.
Who could it be?
I just don't find Tom that exciting anymore.
Tom might be studying right now.
I used to hate them.
Tom stopped laughing.
Tom got up from the couch.
I don't find it that interesting.
What an adorable child!
Tom didn't know what hit him.
Tom didn't drive Mary home.
Give me the tickets.
You're over thirty.
Just deal with it.
She walks.
What's that thing?
The war is essentially over.
I don't know why I didn't see it before.
I want this camera.
How did you find them?
I'll drive.
I wonder what caused your computer to crash.
I came to save you.
I'll have them look at it.
Your complaints upset me.
We're partners.
That wasn't very nice.
I think that's great.
I'll need some tools.
Tom doesn't agree.
Tom believed Mary.
Do you have an alarm clock in your room?
I'm pretty zonked.
Tom wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.
Let me get my stuff.
Isn't there anything?
If you live to seek revenge, best dig a grave for two.
It's all over for us.
Tom died in prison.
The party is over.
We're not sure yet.
I have faith in you, Tom.
He bought a hat.
Here comes the waiter.
America is beautiful.
I need some answers.
I think I could help.
The last time I saw Tom, he was limping.
My neck still hurts.
What should I wear?
Do you have enough?
I feel so helpless.
Tom is very clumsy.
Maybe I should give you a hand.
Don't forget to call him.
We missed you, too.
Tom wanted Mary to understand why he had to leave.
Tom already did that.
Tom spoke quietly so he wouldn't wake the baby.
Can I have a private opinion?
I'm headed that way.
Tom might pull through.
Who is that old man?
She made the juice by herself.
Almost all the phlegm was removed by coughing alone.
I'll call him later.
This is the man I've been waiting for.
I've never cheated on her.
These are our books.
Tom was armed with a kitchen knife.
I get you.
I've already called him.
She gave me an album as a birthday present.
According to Dan, Linda committed suicide.
I'll show that to Tom.
Have you ever seen a whale?
They're downstairs.
Tom dropped the cup.
Don't disturb Tom.
Tom hasn't come back yet.
Have you missed me?
Let's save the ones we can save.
What's the occasion?
Did you arrest them?
We're not going out.
She's the local slut.
Which one do we burn?
This is garbage.
Who are we waiting for?
What's your favorite ballet?
No further discussion is necessary.
How much longer do we have?
Tom is trying to get back in shape.
Maybe I'm in love with Tom.
I don't want to disappoint them.
They're incredible.
The room is spacious and light.
It was a shock.
The last time that happened I didn't know what to do.
The crow spread his wings.
Was that too easy?
One should not make comments.
I baked it for you.
Is Tom still out in the cold?
Tom is already back.
The fall of the empire was inevitable.
We all need more sleep!
The situation seemed hopeless.
I like writing songs about relationships.
Tom puttered around in the garden all morning.
Everyone in the village called her Little Green Riding Hood.
Tom put up with the pain.
Are you calling me fat?
I hardly ever ask questions.
The mother was cruel to her adopted son.
Let's park over there.
Mr Nakamura is at home.
I'm very sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
What made up your mind to quit smoking?
Warn Tom.
What's in your bag?
You are a woman and I am a man.
Make me some coffee.
Tom saw them kissing.
What should we do today?
We were kids together.
We're running away.
Tom wouldn't come.
We have no choice.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
It was just a kiss.
I tried to hide.
We're not the same.
I have information.
What is man's ultimate destiny?
I would've had a good time.
I think Tom is conservative.
Stop putting on an act.
It's a lovely day.
It's very hot today.
What would I do without Tom?
Cheese is a solid food made from the milk of cows, goats, sheep, and other mammals.

The doctor says you're going to need a lot of rest.
It's really not as hard to do as you think it is.
Dan's bedroom was in disarray.
I had one last hope.

What's going on at work?
Tom tried to hit me.
We must leave early.
Time's running out.
I fucking don't know how to translate this sentence, translate it yourself, everybody deal with their own shit.
I'll graduate this year.
This is my favourite subject.
Everything is possible.
Is that a new lamp?
It was on the news.
It's not done yet.
You talk as if you knew everything.
Your path is a difficult one.
I was late for school.
Tom lost his temper.
I'd like to sleep a little longer.

A long time ago, there was a bridge there.
It won't take me long.

Dan took four sleeping pills.
Give him a hand.
Tom is my copilot.
I borrowed money from him.
I hope I'm not late.
Tom is a tough guy.
Pick me up at 2:30.
It has been said that a man at ten is an animal, at twenty a lunatic, at thirty a failure, at forty a fraud, and at fifty a criminal.
Tom opened the drawer and took out a pencil.
It's fun to watch TV.
We've got something.
His family is very big.
This is homemade jam.
Were you able to find him?
What crimes have you committed?
He tickled his little sister until she peed her pants up.
Someone must lead.
This was a bad idea.
What can Tom do for them?
On Sunday service can be slower than usual.
I'll try to keep myself together till I find myself in you.
Did you design this?
There were survivors.
Translate this into English, please.
Everyone is here now.
How much time do you spend on a computer?
I'm getting hungry.
Let's be logical about this.
You'll talk to me.
I've made up my mind.
It always happens the same way.
It smells good!
How do I help them?
Tom is a basketball player.
Tom came back into the living room.
Tom has invited me to come and stay with him in Boston.
Who isn't here?
For those who confuse the verb endings "-тся" and "ться," there's a special little place in Hell prepared just for you.
Shouldn't we go look for them?
Tom gave Mary a peck on the cheek.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tell Tom we're on our way.
You're pretty smart.
That feels better.
Tom needs attention.
How horrible! They stoned the man to death.
We're here.
Tom's conscious.
He's already left.
Turn on the radio.
Tom is so annoying.
I'm the only one who can do that.
What have you done to your ear?
The speaker is young.
We're journalists.
I had that dream again.
Tom looks pretty proud of himself.
No one's buying anyone a drink.
I'm just rambling.

No one likes the loser.
Why is the bus late?
Fortunately, Tom had no internal injuries.
Step on it!
It's just impossible to live with you!
The heater broke.
How many hours is the flight?
It's getting dark. I wonder if it's going to rain.
I had to fire her.
It seems like you're in a bad mood this morning.
Give her something to eat.
You're too good for Tom.
Swimming is my hobby.
Yesterday, Mary gave me a book with a blue cover.
We need to find him.
It just didn't work.
She can foretell the future.
We must do it again.
Here's the problem.
Who said you could go home early?
Tom was bored out of his skull.
