I wonder how they're going to react.
I can't help anyone.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
I've never seen you like this.
This is the shortest way to the station.
Whether you like it or not, you'll have to do it.
I was hungry.
Are you all set to leave?
It has to be subtitled.
Tom can go with you if he likes.
This guy is an outlaw.
I love a challenge.
He may have missed the train.
You have to do this whether you like it or not.
I couldn't look at it any longer.
You're very astute.
Thank you for your letter.
We renovated a house.
It's hard to choose.
Look at what she's wearing!
Do you have any advice for me?
We lost.
You should try to see it.
What's your favorite television program?
Bob must have had an accident.
Was there an autopsy?
My father is so old that he is hard of hearing.

Courage, my friends!
I remember giving Tom some money.
You're my boss.
I usually go to market on Friday.
Do you want me to teach you some swear words?
We can both do it.
I stopped smoking completely 3 months ago.
Control yourself!
Bananas are a good source of potassium.
Who's this message for?
You have many books.
Don't speak so fast.
I should be happy.
Do you have plans tonight?
I wanted to help you.
Tom confuses his right with his left.
I think you should stop giving Tom money.
Is that too expensive for you?
Why wouldn't you let me go to Tom's party?
After dinner, bring your guitar along and we'll sing.
It's raining buckets outside.
I burnt myself on the leg.
We're young.
The crowd filled the streets.
These are the steps that lead straight to failure.
There wasn't a living soul as far as the eye could see.
The crew were all waiting for the news.
I agreed to split the money with Tom.
Tom is looking through the telescope.
She took my words as a joke.
They started picking up stones.
When it comes to dancing I have two left feet.
Are they actually friends?

I find you attractive.
Open the bottle.
I barely restrained the impulse to strike him.
The fact cannot be denied.

What do you think happens then?
I don't want you touching my stuff.
The ear canal sends sound waves to the eardrum.
Could you do this instead of me?
You can't tell anyone about this.
Once you learn it, you never forget.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Does this mean what I think it means?
Don't go near the dog.
No matter how he tried, he could not open the door.
Are you awake?
Why can't people hibernate?
She understands music.
He was sent to prison.
Now, it so happens that I'm afraid of flying.
My advice was not followed.
I know who you want to talk to.
You're thin.
I'd like to make an appointment to see the doctor.
He dressed up as a woman.
Is there something in particular that you want to drink?
Why are these two always fighting?
I don't like to eat fish with many bones.
I've always tried to do the right thing.
With every birthday, we grow older by one year.
Stay a moment.
His toupee looks like a dead cat.
I'm not a doctor, but a teacher.
He's very proud of his custom motorcycle.
We need tools.
I prefer modern furniture.
Why don't you take a break?
I was afraid to say anything.
People change. There's not much you can do about it.
Girls are not welcome.
Go get a drink of water.
We don't have that.
I received your message yesterday.
Let's hope they don't even think about it.
Tom told us that he had a headache.
Rabbits are extremely social animals.
This was a mistake.
No one is saying that.
He has a fertile imagination.

I liked your friends.
I'm glad to see you again.
I tried but failed to stop him.
I want my key back.
I hunt elk in my leisure-time.
Follow him.
I know that Tom is all right now.
Paris is the city of love.
Please drive safely.
His doctor advised him to give up smoking.
It's necessary for you to go.

It was a complete clusterfuck.
I know you're smarter than that.
The day is almost over.
We've got to talk.
I'm friends with a lot of cops.
Here is a present for you in token of our appreciation.
I'm an artist.
Please, wash your hands.
Give it to me straight.

Don't fall asleep too soon.
A page of history is worth a volume of logic.
You gotta get more organized.
I have no desire to try.
I lost my wallet somewhere around here.
I lent her 500 dollars free of interest.
Blow your nose.
Tom knows a shortcut.
Don't worry. I can fix it.
That's the problem, I think.
I spent the weekend with my grandma.
I'm surprised that you're so naïve.
You might want to have someone look into that matter.
We caught him red-handed.
How many kilos may I take?
I can't stop him.
Did he show you the picture?
Thanks for adding me as a friend.
I think you're ready.
As you have insulted him, he is cross with you.
Live a riotous life.
The bear left no stone unturned in his search for fat bugs under the rocks.
I did nothing all day.
No one found any reason to criticize his actions.
I like sauerkraut.
I'm familiar with this neighborhood.
I hate hypocrites.
Most writers are sensitive to criticism.
I really don't understand women.
It's been a hard year.

This place has a mysterious atmosphere to it.
She is poisoned.
What makes you laugh like that?
Would you like me to tell the truth?

This storm is not dangerous. You don't need to worry.
Tom bought himself a new sports car.
When are you going to come?
He had no money and so could not buy any food.
Are we ready to go?
Time to die.
I don't like cheese very much.
That's what I got.
Tom has a sister.
Children often cry just to attract attention.
I felt sorry for her when I heard her story.
You're my best customer.
I did what I could.
What time does the concert start?
Did you have any luck?
We're back.
Don't get me started.
I'm the one who brought the subject up.
She gave me a ride home.
I like to eat hot soup.
Is that why you called?
The decision is not easy.
Stop playing hard to get.
How did that happen?
My dream is to be the First Lady.
An old friend is better than two new ones.
He happens to be off duty today.
Is that deliberate?
I can't believe you would allow this.
I told you the truth.
The wind is shifting.

I can't tune into the radio station. The tuning knob is broken on the radio.
If you want to be free, destroy your television set.
He chanced on a rare book at a second-hand bookstore.
This chair is yours.

I don't understand a word of what he says.
We're all agreed on that.
Have you already read this book?
This is very good.

Do you drink?
I don't want to end up in prison.

It is true that he got full marks on the test.
You've got plenty of time.
Do you really think we'll find Tom?
We have to respect local customs.
I'd like to talk to you in my office.
I was often seized by despair.
No, I just can't remember. The answer completely eludes me.
You know what might happen, don't you?
That was pathetic.
The cat sat on the mat.
You're always finding fault with me.
Did you read that thick book?
You love him more than me.
What a big supermarket!
Nobody was home.
That's the way I like it.
"Do you have a pen?" "Yes, I have one."
Tom is managing all right.
I lost my health insurance.
Don't drink that.
I'm going crazy.
This is just the type of car I want.

I swam two pool lengths.
She doesn't love her boyfriend.
If I'd known that Tom was in the hospital, I'd have visited him.

There are various kinds of coffee.
I think Tom said that.
Tom went that way.
He never really got over it.
What's the boarding time?
Tell us a ghost story.
I think we need to talk.
Girls are girls and boys are boys.
When I was a kid, I was all thumbs.

I work out whenever I can.
What are your plans for this weekend?
Human language is capable of expressing an infinite amount of ideas.
There's a rumor in the air that the firm is going into bankruptcy.
You're not going fast enough.

Tom hasn't won anything yet.
Have you ever seen anything like that?
Wait in the car, OK?
I love your garden.
Have courage!
Look, this is my business card.
I'm a married man now.
It's a way of making sure that the controller is not too aggressive.
Oh! Today is my day.
I can't focus on two things at the same time.
Do you want to give it another try?
She doesn't need to work.
The two sisters were always quarreling with each other.
May I have your attention, please?
Pay attention on the road.
It's no wonder Tom's sleeping poorly; he drinks up to twelve cups of coffee a day.
Tom is very busy now.
You should let the wine breathe for a few minutes before drinking it.
She has a great affection for her parents.
I miss you very much.
This is a very sophisticated device.
You will soon get to like him.
I often read books.
What's your fetish?
Where's the park?

A marathon is pretty exhausting.
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?

We've only got three more days.
Am I in London?

That's why I quit.
Your story doesn't corroborate what I've heard before.
Are you frightened?
Give me time to take a shower.
We only have tea.
Tom lives and works in Boston.

I think Kate is also a clever person.
These flowers are just about to bloom.
Tom doesn't understand what Mary is trying to say.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
Show him who's boss!
Don't expect overtime.
Education is not the filling of a bucket, but the igniting of a fire.
Paying attention to what you are doing is one of the most important keys to success.
Be more precise.
Tom knew he was being followed.
Let's drive as far as the sea.

It seems logical to me.
Take a break.

Those roses are very beautiful.
Everyone keeps on smiling.
I followed him.
Overrated, yes, but it is a good manga.
That's not how it works.
That's not my thing.
It made me very happy.
Tom might've lied about that.
I guess I fell asleep.
How can you be so sure?

Let's walk to the bookstore.
They will not pass!
He promised not to tell that to anyone.
Would you like to go fishing next weekend?

I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that.
Today, I'm not in a mood to see you.
Honestly, I don't think you have what it takes to become a teacher.
He just returned from abroad.

I have an appointment with my lawyer today.
He got caught.
We've got to talk.
John has no friends here.
Don't put words in my mouth that I haven't said.
He felt utterly humiliated.
That would've been the right thing to do.
That was you, wasn't it?
This is good news.
Oi!
Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail. So whatever we think of the past, we must not be prisoners of it.
We're getting out of here. The storm is coming.
Remove the bandage.
Tom's dog is well-trained.
What are you hiding?
On the one eye, watch the outside world, on the other look deep inside yourself.
I don't feel like going out tonight.
Tom only does that when he's tired.
Sorry, something went wrong.
If we let our reasoning power be overshadowed by our emotions, we would be barking up the wrong tree all the time.
It was a pleasure working with you folks.

It is a pity you cannot come.
You should be out of here by tomorrow.
Tommy couldn't answer the last question.
We nearly starved.
Anything new today?
Wherever you may go, you'll be welcomed.
How do you feel now?
Goodnight, Timmy.
I have no backup plan.
I'm now able to do that by myself.
I don't understand this gobbledygook.
I caught her by the hand.
It's beautifully made.
How did you enjoy the movie?
Eat more vegetables.
Sports are effective to cultivate friendship.
I think we both know how Tom feels.
It is dark in that room.
The last volume is missing from this set.

He has a video.
It's very simple.
Do you love him?
I gave him all the money I had.
Stop bothering her.
This is the season to pick fresh tea.
I was criticized.
He posed a problem.
Remind me later.
I fear that it will rain tomorrow.
Who are we visiting today?
He got what he wanted.
The results that you get depend on the values of the parameters that you set.
We lost all of our funding.

You didn't have to say yes.
I apologize to all of you.
I hope everyone is happy.
He stays a long time every time he comes.
Where's my microphone?
France should be full.
Isn't one of you enough?
Tom is a mutant.
I have exactly what you need.
That box is heavy.
She doesn't like me.
You may go at once.
I am deeply grateful to you for your kindness.
There's something about this translation that isn't quite right.
Thank you for the wonderful meal.
This music makes me sick.
In order to stay awake I may have to drink more coffee.

Try this cake.
Take anything you want.
Tom kept his gun pointed at Mary and told her not to move.
Why don't you take the cat out with you?
She is loved by everybody.
You should have told me the truth.
Don't pay it any heed.
It's very interesting.
We have the same problems as you.
I don't want you to be upset.
May your soul rest in peace.
This one is for us.
What's the point of your question?
Why don't we do this later?
I am given a monthly allowance of fifty thousand yen.
The expression "portable" is ambiguous, as you don't know whether it refers to a telephone, a computer, or another portable device.
Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the cost.
You're the only person I know that owns a gun.
He has two sons, I believe.
It's my day off.
They worked like bees.
Don't count on them.
Is this book yours?

He always values his wife's opinions.
When can I see you again?
Mary took her necklace off.
Come over here. I'll give you a massage.
Something happened.
